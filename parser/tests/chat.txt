23/07/2020, 19:36 - Mike: ‚ù§Ô∏è
24/07/2020, 10:42 - Noone: Warhammer 40,000 darktide trailer looks like a 40k L4D so hyped
24/07/2020, 10:44 - James: Have you played vermintide?
24/07/2020, 11:33 - Kirky: <Media omitted>
24/07/2020, 11:35 - Mike: <Media omitted>
24/07/2020, 11:36 - Wezz: You bastard
24/07/2020, 11:49 - Noone: Negatory
24/07/2020, 11:49 - Noone: Oh fuck
24/07/2020, 11:53 - Dayle: Oh wow that looks amazing
24/07/2020, 11:53 - Dayle: Lunch time league?

24/07/2020, 12:48 - Kirky: <Media omitted>
24/07/2020, 12:51 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
24/07/2020, 12:58 - James: It's Warhammer fantasy left for dead, killing rat people with sword and magic
24/07/2020, 17:09 - Mike: lool, yeh definitely a close one. Tapan's misses was on my side but I had just cooked delicious BBQ so she may be biased
24/07/2020, 17:11 - Mike: this a comment on their video?
24/07/2020, 17:11 - Wezz: Well you were adamant that it was 3 syllables üòâ
24/07/2020, 17:11 - Wezz: Lool yeah
24/07/2020, 17:12 - Mike: I'm just willing to accept BBC English is the de facto standard of English world wide, America be damned
24/07/2020, 17:12 - Mike: you plebs with your accents
24/07/2020, 17:12 - Wezz: I was merely demonstrating my candour
24/07/2020, 17:13 - Wezz: BBC English IS the de facto standard. Hence the BBC documentaries saying mar-gret.
24/07/2020, 17:13 - Mike: We should write to the queen for a final arbitration
24/07/2020, 17:13 - Mike: not like shes doing anything atm locked up
24/07/2020, 17:13 - Wezz: That's what made it even funnier tbf

24/07/2020, 18:46 - Piper: Cld start there
24/07/2020, 18:46 - Dayle: Yeah sounds good
24/07/2020, 19:11 - Paul: Piper isn't real

24/07/2020, 19:44 - Kirky: hes in germany dude you cant call him that
24/07/2020, 19:44 - Kirky: he'll get arrested

24/07/2020, 20:14 - Mike: "So, what right do we have to claim the Sun as our own?"

Alien simp detected
24/07/2020, 21:03 - Wezz: Holy fuck. The express are printing it? Must be true. FUCKYOUALIENS
25/07/2020, 10:02 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
25/07/2020, 10:02 - Dayle: BANNED
25/07/2020, 10:25 - Paul: How many bananas could you eat in 1 sitting
25/07/2020, 10:25 - Lockers: 36.45
25/07/2020, 10:25 - Dayle: 6
25/07/2020, 10:26 - Paul: 6 is legit lockers no way
25/07/2020, 10:27 - Lockers: Sorry I thought you said 6 sittings
25/07/2020, 10:28 - Lockers: 6.777777777777777
25/07/2020, 10:28 - Mike: Does inserting them into my bum count as eating?
25/07/2020, 10:28 - Mike: My arsehole has teeth if that helps
25/07/2020, 10:29 - Paul: Yes but it has to be in 1 sitting
25/07/2020, 10:30 - James: You have to pile them end to end and take them all in one motion
25/07/2020, 10:31 - James: I reckon if there was money in it and I had prep time, 10-12?
25/07/2020, 10:31 - Tapan: About 30-40
25/07/2020, 10:31 - Tapan: Just like the olives
25/07/2020, 10:31 - Mike: Sitting as one arse motion or one meal?
25/07/2020, 10:31 - James: One arse motion my dude
25/07/2020, 10:32 - Mike: However much money directly correlates to how much arse motion
25/07/2020, 10:37 - James: Gotta make it rain for the full range of movement
25/07/2020, 10:38 - Mike: What's the prep time used for?
25/07/2020, 10:42 - Wezz: I'm very doubtful. Maybe some explanation around the prep time would clear things up
25/07/2020, 10:59 - Paul: Nah sitting means one session. Defined here to be constantly eating/ass inserting without breaks (breaks determined by a 3rd party referee, you're given leeway to take long breathes and drink small sips of water but beyond that you're disqualified at the refs discretion)
25/07/2020, 11:00 - Wezz: Big reach here. You letting this slide (C) Paulo?
25/07/2020, 11:01 - Paul: I already said no way to lockers with a similar estimate
25/07/2020, 11:01 - Paul: People are underestimating how much bananas can make you feel sick
25/07/2020, 11:05 - Wezz: Have a few qs:
1. Can I blend the bananas?
2. Since anal is allowed, I assume we're good with all transmucosal routes?
3. Do I have to survive?
25/07/2020, 11:05 - James: Fasting
25/07/2020, 11:05 - James: Gotta make room
25/07/2020, 11:06 - Paul: 1. No, we're using a strict banana term here meaning a whole solid banana (equal size).
2. Sure.
3. Yes.
25/07/2020, 11:06 - James: Kayleigh thinks she would be tapping out after 2 bananas
25/07/2020, 11:07 - Wezz: In the bum or in the belly?
25/07/2020, 11:07 - Mike: The real masters use both ends
25/07/2020, 11:07 - Paul: Women have more options really
25/07/2020, 11:08 - Wezz: Nah... Don't lie to me
25/07/2020, 11:09 - Mike: Not if she wants to stay pure of sin
25/07/2020, 11:09 - Wezz: 1. Liquidising it in my mouth is permitted though right?
25/07/2020, 11:09 - James: She's pretty insistent that she stays sinless
25/07/2020, 11:10 - Paul: Julia said "Paul you've lost sight of reality and you're obsessed with bananas" and left with a suitcase.

Nice of her to go get some bananas
25/07/2020, 11:10 - Wezz: No chance. Rookie thought process right there
25/07/2020, 11:10 - James: You think you could do a suitcase full?
25/07/2020, 11:10 - Paul: I mean yeah obviously you don't have to swallow it whold
25/07/2020, 11:11 - Wezz: Explained to Noora and she sighed and has gone to make breakfast.

Can't wait for banana bread
25/07/2020, 11:12 - Wezz: I don't appreciate your tone.

Skin on or off?
25/07/2020, 11:13 - Mike: Oh man now way I could insert a banana with skin on up my bum
25/07/2020, 11:13 - Paul: Are you a psychopath
25/07/2020, 11:13 - Paul: No skins
25/07/2020, 11:13 - Paul: Prepeeled unless peeling is important for your prep/strat
25/07/2020, 11:14 - Mike: Then again, the skin may help with the insertion, no pushing up
25/07/2020, 11:14 - Mike: Mushing *
25/07/2020, 11:14 - Paul: As long as the mushing occurs internally you're good
25/07/2020, 11:15 - Mike: That's my tinder bio
25/07/2020, 11:17 - Wezz: I needed this clarification, thanks.
25/07/2020, 11:18 - Wezz: What constitutes 'eaten'. If being inside my bum counts. Does being inside my mouth count?
25/07/2020, 11:18 - Wezz: Can I have some boundaries please Paul.
25/07/2020, 11:19 - Mike: Always stickler for the rules this guy, dont tell him Paul he will try to find loopholes
25/07/2020, 11:19 - Wezz: Can't expect this proposition to be taken seriously if you don't properly outline the rules.
25/07/2020, 11:21 - Mike: Spoken like a true communist
25/07/2020, 11:23 - Paul: I've been through this. Just serenade her with a romantic version of bananas in pyjamas. If she starts crying that just means its working
25/07/2020, 11:24 - Paul: Bum there is a bit more relay as the space is more limited, no digestive enzymes or tract. So anal insertion only requires entry. Mouth requires swallowing. Anus would too if it could swallow
25/07/2020, 11:24 - Paul: Leeway* not relay
25/07/2020, 11:26 - Mike: That's what you think
25/07/2020, 11:27 - Wezz: Thanks for clearing that up. I'm optimistic for the future of the sport.
25/07/2020, 11:27 - Lockers: Ok wtf is going on
25/07/2020, 11:40 - James: Can I have a rigourous regime over 6 months if regularly inflating my bowel to fit more in?
25/07/2020, 11:40 - James: Or is that like doping?
25/07/2020, 11:55 - Paul: It would depend. Is there a test for that? Otherwise how are we to know? We aren't gonna do mris before the day
25/07/2020, 11:55 - Kirky: Sounds fatphobic to deny James that option
25/07/2020, 11:56 - Paul: We aren't excluding body types but what James is suggesting is more akin to body modding
25/07/2020, 11:56 - Paul: Plus I actually didn't deny it
25/07/2020, 12:11 - James: Can I sit on a modified chair that uses compressed air to blast bananas into my asshole?
25/07/2020, 12:12 - Nathan: Caught up dont worry. So are the bananas going to be normal/mini? Is there a specification for banana size, shape, girth?
25/07/2020, 12:12 - Wezz: I would hope the athletic commission managed the dimensions of the bananas
25/07/2020, 12:13 - Wezz: No less than competition grade
25/07/2020, 12:13 - Wezz: I thought you signed my NDA? I'm taking you to court bitch
25/07/2020, 12:13 - Nathan: Oh of course! But ahead of the qualifiers would we be made aware of the actual competition specifications?
25/07/2020, 12:13 - Wezz: First time banana boy?
25/07/2020, 12:14 - Nathan: Yeah first competition I'm a little nervous
25/07/2020, 12:15 - Wezz: Ah no problem.
According to the U.K. Banana Athletics Commission, an competition-sized banana weighs approximately 4 ounces and measures at least 7 inches -- but less than 8 inches -- in length.
25/07/2020, 12:16 - James: Listen man, all the power shouldn't be with a few, all should able to blast their own ass
25/07/2020, 12:16 - Wezz: Sorry to banana ball you like that. Just part of tradition you know.
25/07/2020, 12:17 - Nathan: I've heard it's a tough competitive sport so I get it. Thanks for clarification!
25/07/2020, 12:18 - Wezz: This sort of fence-sitting will lead to divergence in the competitive ruleset. Eagerly awaiting your conclusion on body modding.
25/07/2020, 12:20 - Wezz: I thought we had a deal.

*The Bugatti Blasters*

Could have won it all with horse power like that in my ass. You'll regret going it alone.
25/07/2020, 12:22 - James: Seize the ass of eruption, Down with the bananargeoise.
25/07/2020, 12:27 - Wezz: Stick to the amatuer leagues you marxist peasant üçå
25/07/2020, 12:28 - Dayle: good fun - weekend few bevs game - fall guys
25/07/2020, 14:24 - Paul: Banana blaster chairs are approved but we don't want to be seen as giving unfair advantages to richer competitors so the comity will provide them to everyone
25/07/2020, 14:25 - Paul: Realistically the body mods are banned. But we lack the capacity to properly enforce it. So we want to remain within the confounds of the spirit of competition for banana sports
25/07/2020, 14:26 - Wezz: Need a manufacturer for all these banana blaster chairs? Happy to go through tender
25/07/2020, 14:26 - Wezz: Bugatti engines, blasting bananas so far up your bum you won't feel a thing.
25/07/2020, 14:30 - Wezz: Appreciate your honesty. But do you recall the olmypic tag team banana relay circa 1942? We don't want a repeat of that nonsense.

"Spirit of the banana" my ass
25/07/2020, 15:09 - Derren: <Media omitted>
25/07/2020, 15:11 - Wezz: CLEVER GIRL. Imitation shot coming later tonight
25/07/2020, 15:23 - James: I've asked Alex, he wanted to know if he can have a dipping bowl of custard
25/07/2020, 16:46 - Paul: I mean sure... that's just more food
25/07/2020, 16:47 - Paul: Wezz we're reinventing the sport. The game had become too stale and slow. Too formal and elitist. We no longer require tuxedos or quiet crowds. It's about flashy stories and teamwork now.
25/07/2020, 17:02 - Wezz: You've forgotten what made the sport unique Paul.
25/07/2020, 17:19 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
25/07/2020, 17:30 - Mike: Except googleüëç
25/07/2020, 17:34 - Mike: I've asked 8 from work people which I'm counting as a big enough sample size as being accurate, 6 for 3 syllable and 2 for 2 syllable
25/07/2020, 17:35 - Wezz: You work with fin-techs. They're barely literate.
25/07/2020, 17:35 - Wezz: Did you ask them in binary?
25/07/2020, 17:36 - James: Wezz, I had a similar issue recently. I was marked wrong for saying violence has 2 syllables. Apparently that also has 3, despite nobody pronouncing it Vi-o-lence
25/07/2020, 17:40 - Wezz: Haha well I say violence as three. But yeah, i believe it's accent/dialect dependent and could say it either way, 2 or 3 !

Mike is just adamant Margaret is 3 and it makes me laugh.
25/07/2020, 17:41 - Wezz: I think his nan was called Mar-gar-ret or something
25/07/2020, 17:41 - Nathan: Mar-garet
25/07/2020, 17:41 - James: I can't believe this. I stick up for you and you immediately turncoat against me
25/07/2020, 17:41 - Wezz: Loool
25/07/2020, 17:42 - Wezz: I'm a man of honesty. What can I say. Can't go round saying vi-lence
25/07/2020, 17:42 - Wezz: I pronounce the O
25/07/2020, 17:45 - Wezz: So a lot of people say Mar-g'ret. Skip the middle vowel change in pronunciation. Violence is another good one tbf.
25/07/2020, 17:50 - Dayle: Ju-st fa-ck wi-th th-is sh-it cuckolds

25/07/2020, 18:11 - Nathan: I think you'll find its cuck-olds
25/07/2020, 18:34 - James: Only plebians don't pronounce it Cu-cuh-olds
25/07/2020, 18:34 - James: Clearly 3 syllables
25/07/2020, 19:52 - Kirky: any of you gays on tonight for UFC AND SHOTS?

25/07/2020, 20:11 - Kirky: LEFT a game of league for it
25/07/2020, 20:11 - Wezz: They should call you SLO-CKERS
25/07/2020, 20:12 - Wezz: You are disgusting and dirty
25/07/2020, 20:13 - Wezz: Maybe you should leave the game of valorant for league. Complete the betrayal

15/08/2020, 12:17 - Derren: When Disney bought fox, fox were offering very nice redundancy packages
15/08/2020, 12:18 - Derren: You either got 1 month for every year of service or 50% of your salary, whichever is higher
15/08/2020, 12:18 - Derren: 1 month pay that is
15/08/2020, 12:19 - Derren: And after 18 months Disney have told me they want to Tupe me to a 3rd party managed service IT company called ATOS where I would just do shitty robot jobs on the same pay I'm on now
15/08/2020, 12:19 - Derren: I made some noise so instead of that happening my job ends 30th september
15/08/2020, 12:19 - Derren: and I'm getting 50% of my salary tax free as a parting gift

15/08/2020, 12:21 - Derren: They didn't have to offer me the settlement agreement paul
15/08/2020, 12:22 - Derren: they could have sent me to Atos and I would have worked there for 6 months and been let go with statutory pay of 2 weeks
15/08/2020, 12:22 - Paul: No it's too late. Take them down
15/08/2020, 12:22 - Mike: 6 months later, Derren owns Walt Disney

15/08/2020, 12:25 - Derren: Would pull the racism card
15/08/2020, 12:25 - Derren: you can only be racist to black people if you didn't know

18/08/2020, 21:22 - Lockers: Any good?
18/08/2020, 21:23 - Paul: Yeah I'm enjoying it. Jumps around a lot like a real conversation but he's got a million anecdotes if you like magic it's great
18/08/2020, 21:23 - Wezz: Is he still playing a weirdo character?
18/08/2020, 21:24 - Wezz: one day hoping he interviews out of character

19/08/2020, 10:14 - Paul: Agree with this wholeheartedly. Way better than those fad diets you used to do
19/08/2020, 10:26 - Dayle: :(
19/08/2020, 10:26 - Paul: That's a complement dude I'm saying i like this way best

19/08/2020, 10:30 - Paul: Just chalk it up to a learning experience. And keep up the good work! Are you lifting weights as well or nah?
19/08/2020, 10:31 - Lockers: Alright we get it you went to the gym once. Dayle just go kick a ball and the pounds will fall off, trust me
19/08/2020, 10:31 - Dayle: I‚Äôll kick your balls in, is that what you tell your students come play with my balls you sicko
19/08/2020, 10:32 - Paul: Classic 2 sausage lockers

19/08/2020, 10:37 - Dayle: Nope I think you mentioned it :) but yeah would be greatly appreciated thank you
19/08/2020, 10:38 - Wezz: How do to swim like fsh?
19/08/2020, 10:38 - Paul: First tip: don't breathe the water
19/08/2020, 10:40 - Paul: Sorry you lack the requisite surname
19/08/2020, 10:40 - Lockers: You realise I was having a dig at Paul, right?
19/08/2020, 10:41 - Lockers: Next you're gonna give advice on the best sweets to try
19/08/2020, 10:41 - Dayle: I take it back then, my most sincerest apologies good sir, but it‚Äôs is weird you get students to play with your balls
19/08/2020, 10:41 - Paul: As a finale I'm gonna be recommending mental illnesses to everyone
19/08/2020, 10:41 - Lockers: This does not happen
19/08/2020, 10:42 - Lockers: Well at least you could give genuine first hand experiences of this one
19/08/2020, 10:43 - Paul: Hey I'll have you know I have a multitude of first hand experience eating sweets too
19/08/2020, 10:43 - Paul: Not sure that makes sense grammatically but w.e
19/08/2020, 11:00 - Wezz: Genuinely interested, do you know if your lineage links back to fisherman in some meaningful way?
19/08/2020, 11:01 - Paul: I know that my grandparents had our coat of arms but that's it
19/08/2020, 11:03 - Paul: My interesting lineage is on my mum's side. Landed gentry, aristocracy, war time admirals, manner houses, then it all went to shit lol
19/08/2020, 11:04 - Paul: Manor*
19/08/2020, 11:04 - Kirky: And now theres you
19/08/2020, 11:08 - Paul: Look up delamere manor.  It was where my great grandparents grew up. But it wasn't allowed to be passed down to a woman so it went to a distant relative who had a male heir
19/08/2020, 11:11 - Paul: Something called an entail? I don't know much about it
19/08/2020, 11:26 - Dayle: claim that shit back
19/08/2020, 12:10 - Wezz: That's pretty crazy. Patriarchal ways

19/08/2020, 12:16 - Paul: The pastey skinned  upper classes confirmed
19/08/2020, 12:18 - Kirky: were they rich?
19/08/2020, 12:19 - Paul: There are definitely some wealthy families within the larger network. So far removed that we basically aren't family though
19/08/2020, 12:20 - Paul: The ones that inherited delamere obviously are.

19/08/2020, 12:37 - Paul: You mean deep in the catacombs
19/08/2020, 12:37 - Kirky: cables running over the bones of your ancestors
19/08/2020, 12:37 - Paul: As god intended
19/08/2020, 12:38 - Mike: do bones block or boost wifi signals?
19/08/2020, 12:39 - Lockers: Sorry was that not covered in your degree?

19/08/2020, 12:44 - Paul: I literally googled fastest colour and it just says in bold *red* lmao
19/08/2020, 12:45 - James: Yeah, don't get me started on its wavespeed
19/08/2020, 12:45 - Kirky: you didnt even give us the legit scientific reason "Violet travels the slowest so it is on the bottom and red travels the fastest so is on the top. This is because what is called the index of refraction, (the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to the speed of light in a material), is increased for the slower moving waves (i.e. violet)."

19/08/2020, 13:48 - Paul: I feel like articles like that raise enough awareness that the prices might not fall but I'm no economist
19/08/2020, 14:03 - Piper: If I were a bull I would run faster if I saw red. But I'm a jeep so I go beep beep
19/08/2020, 14:05 - Paul: Hate to break it to you but bulls are colourblind
19/08/2020, 14:05 - Paul: So are jeeps

21/08/2020, 07:58 - Kirky: Yes I'm on a plane rn
21/08/2020, 08:09 - Paul: It's pretty awesome but insanely exhausting. Takes like 6-7 hours constant upward hiking. Every time I'm drenched in sweat lol. Totally worth it though for that view
21/08/2020, 08:10 - Dayle: ok maybe next year?
21/08/2020, 08:11 - Paul: For sure
21/08/2020, 08:29 - Kirky: Yea 100% up for it. I've learnt this week my uphill game is trash so I'll work on that üòÇ flatish I could go all day

21/08/2020, 08:42 - Wezz: That's what I thought first! Podracing or whatever. But then I realised it was someone's legs?
21/08/2020, 08:44 - Wezz: Lool fuck Ben Shapiro. Literally zero humility
21/08/2020, 08:48 - Wezz: Watched the guy training for this, was pretty awesome:

21/08/2020, 08:49 - Wezz: Loads of glitchy stuff where he has to lie on the ground to deceive the VR.
21/08/2020, 08:49 - Paul: Guess it's full of spoilers
21/08/2020, 08:52 - Wezz: Yeah, he plays through most of the game. Loads of skipping through which prevents loading of textured and models
21/08/2020, 08:52 - Wezz: So it's a weird one
21/08/2020, 08:53 - Paul: You guys aware of the Britney spears shit that people are talking about? Check out her Instagram. She's always posting these weird videos answering questions no one asked. People are saying stuff like "if you're in trouble post a video wearing yellow" and she does. It's kinda creepy. She's currently trying to remove her father as her conservator as he runs her life and her estate. People even think her boyfriend is fake.
21/08/2020, 08:55 - Paul: I'll check it out. I doubt I'll get VR so I guess I don't care about spoilers
21/08/2020, 08:58 - Dayle: But it‚Äôs Britney bitch
21/08/2020, 08:59 - Paul: True
21/08/2020, 09:15 - Mike: Not even the slightest, hasn't she had a problem with her Dad forever? Isn't he what caused her breakdown when she was young? Can't really remember

24/08/2020, 12:41 - Noone: Views shared by Piper do not reflect values held by Piper's Pizza LTD.
24/08/2020, 12:51 - Nathan: Disgusting behaviour from someone who is in the public eye. You need to rethink that decision before you lose the respect and admiration of the country
24/08/2020, 13:09 - Paul: Pipers pizza Ltd. Is plummeting in the market since his comment btw. I'd sell up before you're all broke
24/08/2020, 13:10 - Nathan: Already off loaded all my shares straight after the comment, made a loss but reinvested into Paul's pizzeria instead. Feels like the safe option

25/08/2020, 23:06 - Dayle: Its like dark souls combat but faster with a runescape style leveling system its quite good
25/08/2020, 23:07 - Qck: It lost its main devs and was in dev hell for a bit, removed any reason to PvP and guild battles are ai based or some shit
25/08/2020, 23:07 - Wezz: PvP 50v50 looks pretty mad.

25/08/2020, 23:10 - Qck: Is hitting rocks your version of getting on it
25/08/2020, 23:11 - Dayle: Haha üòÑ
25/08/2020, 23:11 - Wezz: i bang 7g rocks np
25/08/2020, 23:11 - Qck: Yeah it's a version of the cryengine
25/08/2020, 23:12 - Qck: So the same shit that ruined your graphics card with crysis
25/08/2020, 23:12 - Qck: And ruined derek's life with aion
25/08/2020, 23:12 - Wezz: Aion runs on CryEngine?
25/08/2020, 23:12 - Wezz: Didn't know that, thought it looked meh
25/08/2020, 23:13 - Wezz: Crysis 1 looked insane
25/08/2020, 23:13 - Qck: Bruh I'm Patrick Moore's floating head, of course it does
25/08/2020, 23:13 - Wezz: better than console Crysis 2 tbh
25/08/2020, 23:13 - Wezz: loooool
25/08/2020, 23:14 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
25/08/2020, 23:14 - Wezz: What a trip down memory lane
25/08/2020, 23:16 - Paul: Sam is telling us a game is bad when he's never played it while Dayle says it's good and is actually playing it. I'm gonna have to defer to piper on this one.
25/08/2020, 23:16 - Dayle: I do really enjoy the self sufficiency from the land is more rewarding than other ganes
25/08/2020, 23:48 - Mike: Piper, what's your feelings on the blockchain?

26/08/2020, 14:05 - Kirky: not for ¬£40
26/08/2020, 14:05 - Kirky: is it the one where your guild can build a castle and control territory?
26/08/2020, 14:05 - Dayle: refund it after you played preview :D
26/08/2020, 14:06 - Kirky: with really slow combat
26/08/2020, 14:16 - Wezz: Piper, I'm feeling a bit bloated, what medication would you recommend?
26/08/2020, 14:20 - James: Piper, I'm looking to curse me neighbor after they stole a sheep, can you help?
26/08/2020, 14:32 - Mike: Any of you guys use a wireless headset? I'm sick of being tethered to this mortal coil by my head
26/08/2020, 14:32 - Mike: want recommendations
26/08/2020, 14:34 - Lockers: Ask piper
26/08/2020, 14:37 - Dayle: @447835575116 how many lengths in 30mins is good
26/08/2020, 14:37 - Dayle: 25m pool
26/08/2020, 14:40 - Derren: 200
26/08/2020, 14:40 - Dayle: *enter mum joke about taking 200 lengths a day*
26/08/2020, 14:43 - Mike: Piper is being an adult and actually working, anyway Linus reviewed and recommended: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Logitech-981-000744-G935-NA-EMEA-Shwarz/dp/B07MTY7N22

26/08/2020, 14:53 - Kirky: no open world pvp, no chance lol
26/08/2020, 14:53 - Dayle: there is open world pvp
26/08/2020, 14:53 - Dayle: what you CHATTING bruv
26/08/2020, 14:53 - Dayle: its mad pvp
26/08/2020, 14:58 - Kirky: explain it to me
26/08/2020, 14:58 - Kirky: all im reading is its opt in territory guild v guild fights
26/08/2020, 15:02 - Kirky: Also did they keep the system where only high rated guilds/ well established guilds coul make the best weapons / armour ?
26/08/2020, 15:22 - Kirky: I realise I sound very critical but the last mmo release I had was so astronomically bad idk if I ever wanna try one again
26/08/2020, 15:24 - Paul: 50-60
26/08/2020, 15:25 - Paul: Depends on a lot though mate. Stroke, tumble turns, etc
26/08/2020, 15:25 - Paul: And depends what you mean by good.
26/08/2020, 15:26 - Dayle: damn im up to 42
26/08/2020, 15:27 - Paul: Dude that ain't bad. Keep it up. Front crawl?
26/08/2020, 15:29 - Dayle: front crawl with breast stroke breaks
26/08/2020, 15:30 - Paul: Once you get it to all crawl you'll break 50 easy. Just gotta work on the breathing
26/08/2020, 15:31 - Lockers: Don't breathe underwater though man

26/08/2020, 17:41 - Wezz: no idea about value for money. just know that all studios use them and i have some wired that have lasted me 5 years. changed the ear pads for ¬£12 once in that time
26/08/2020, 17:41 - Wezz: avoid gaming brands
26/08/2020, 17:42 - Wezz: that's about all my advice
26/08/2020, 17:47 - Mike: No microphone on them?
26/08/2020, 17:47 - Wezz: get a desk usb mic for ¬£10
26/08/2020, 17:47 - Wezz: donezo
26/08/2020, 17:48 - Wezz: get drowned by groovy like a real man
26/08/2020, 17:53 - Derren: desk usb mic sucks if you don't have it mounted
26/08/2020, 17:53 - Derren: picks up your keyboard etc
26/08/2020, 17:54 - Wezz: If you don't push to talk I guess..
26/08/2020, 17:54 - Wezz: But yeah, fair point
26/08/2020, 17:55 - Wezz: I just find the combos to be shit. But that's my experience. Plus used to xlr studio mics
26/08/2020, 18:14 - Derren: Well it all depends on how much money you want to spunk
26/08/2020, 18:15 - Mike: ¬£100-200~
26/08/2020, 18:15 - Derren: I decided a few years ago that stuff I'm using for many many hours everyday deserves to have a bit extra $ spent on them and usually that comes with better build & quality

26/08/2020, 18:20 - Qck: Get some proper headphones and a nice condenser mic is my advice
26/08/2020, 18:21 - Qck: Headsets are gross and for call centres and call of duty
26/08/2020, 18:23 - Derren: I mean a wireless headset is nice
26/08/2020, 18:23 - Derren: if you wanna chat shit from the kitchen / toilet but yeah, endgame audio is a good dac + headphones and xlr mic
26/08/2020, 18:23 - Derren: But decent shit is expensive
26/08/2020, 18:24 - Qck: Agreed on everything except the term "dac"
26/08/2020, 18:26 - Derren: Dac/amp whatever you wanna call it lol
26/08/2020, 18:32 - Qck: Honestly much rather have a usb audio interface and notice a difference in the way my sound is processed than have a digital converter doing fucking nada
26/08/2020, 18:32 - Derren: What is your XLR mic connected to?
26/08/2020, 18:33 - Qck: An AKAI usb ai
26/08/2020, 18:34 - Qck: Does it's own digital audio processing, lowers latency for midi and audio, different audio drivers etc
26/08/2020, 18:37 - Qck: Also means you have a lot of channels that allows speakers/headphones/microphone/guitar/midi all at once in just a little box
26/08/2020, 18:39 - Qck: Plus you're widening the window in which you're listening to sound as opposed to just lessening interference on your crappy sound
26/08/2020, 18:40 - Qck: Now if you will all turn to page 42 as we start to look at headphone and monitor correction software

27/08/2020, 11:41 - Paul: Do wireless headphones still have a delay that would have an impact for competitive fps games? Considering getting some myself
27/08/2020, 11:41 - Dayle: If you find out that Paul i might get some
27/08/2020, 11:52 - Wezz: Yeah quite often 100+ms delay
27/08/2020, 11:53 - Wezz: But you're all shit at games so doubt it'll matter
27/08/2020, 11:54 - Lockers: @447972133417 has some I think and he tries to play fps (cheating though according to @447835575116)
27/08/2020, 11:55 - Paul: If wireless headphones can give me the knowledge bayley has then I'm getting some
27/08/2020, 11:56 - Mike: Not enough that it'd matter to your shit aim
27/08/2020, 11:57 - Nathan: Your 30 year old reactions have more delay that wireless headphone don't worry ü§£
27/08/2020, 11:58 - Paul: Are you sure about this? Because wireless gaming mice literally have compatible latency to wired at this point. Some are actually supposedly quicker
27/08/2020, 11:59 - Paul: You're confusing exogenous attentional facilitation for endogenous
27/08/2020, 12:07 - Wezz: Supposedly quicker? Are you mad
27/08/2020, 12:08 - Paul: In a meeting I can link you after
27/08/2020, 12:09 - Wezz: I'm googling. But just based on my understanding of wireless transmission options all have slight delays with encoding/decoding. So getting past those would be impossible.
27/08/2020, 12:10 - Wezz: Probably some shit claim by some gaming company when comparing to the 'average wireless mouse'
27/08/2020, 12:10 - Wezz: *wired
27/08/2020, 12:27 - Wezz: Yeah saw the Logitech marketing claims. Haven't seen any reproduction.
Wireless mice should generally have at least 2x latency.
27/08/2020, 12:28 - Mike: *when measured against a eiredmouse with a 25 mile long cable*
27/08/2020, 12:28 - Mike: Wired mouse*
27/08/2020, 12:32 - Kirky: Travelling through wood
27/08/2020, 12:56 - Paul: https://www.gamersnexus.net/guides/2594-wireless-mouse-click-latency-analysis-vs-wired
27/08/2020, 12:57 - Paul: Dunno how reliable the results are tbh, but it's definitely within the realms of "actually supposedly" - So I don't think I'm mad üòâ
27/08/2020, 12:57 - Derren: Gamers nexus are people you can trust
27/08/2020, 12:59 - Paul: The result is that the Logitech mice perform within the ~3~6ms range for click latency, where the Razer mouse performs within the ~9~12ms range for latency.

Although data supports Logitech's mice as faster in delivering the completed input, the difference between the two is largely irrelevant and would be obfuscated by the much slower human latency. What this data does definitively show, though, is that a well-constructed wireless mouse is not inherently, significantly slower than a well-constructed wired mouse.
27/08/2020, 13:05 - Wezz: I'm confused. They're not claiming it's faster in their conclusion? But they do in results?
27/08/2020, 13:07 - Lockers: Silly question, is this using the wireless mouse or just a logitech wired mouse? Because the conclusion makes no sense unless they're saying that "a logitech mouse is faster than razer therefore with the latency of being wireless its therefore not significantly slower than a wired"?
27/08/2020, 13:08 - Lockers: Therefore therefore
27/08/2020, 13:11 - Paul: Logitech wireless, razer wired
27/08/2020, 13:11 - Lockers: So their conclusion makes no sense?
27/08/2020, 13:12 - Paul: Why?
27/08/2020, 13:12 - Lockers: Or rather the wording is poor
27/08/2020, 13:12 - Paul: In the bit I quoted or from the article?
27/08/2020, 13:12 - Lockers: Well the results show its faster, but their conclusion doesn't say it is?
27/08/2020, 13:12 - Lockers: Yeah
27/08/2020, 13:13 - Paul: Which
27/08/2020, 13:13 - Lockers: Sorry the quote. Thought you said the bit I quoted from the article
27/08/2020, 13:13 - Lockers: Didn't see your link
27/08/2020, 13:17 - Paul: I really don't understand the confusion, there is nothing contradictory in the conclusion or results
27/08/2020, 13:17 - James: I'll contradict your face in a minute
27/08/2020, 13:22 - Lockers: Do it
27/08/2020, 13:42 - Wezz: Yeah wording is shit I agree with the teacher. But w/e. Get yourself a Logitech (TM). It's _not inherently, significantly_ slower than your mum
27/08/2020, 13:44 - Wezz: They're using Logitech custom pcb testing kit at a symposium stand PAX
27/08/2020, 13:46 - Paul: whilst we cant definitively say its A, we can confidently say its not B
27/08/2020, 13:48 - Wezz: Tbh my knowledge was based on Bluetooth 5 transfer delays. But that mouse uses 2.4GHz wireless so could well be accurate.
27/08/2020, 13:49 - Mike: I usually a wireless keyboard and mouse to watch porn in bed, never noticed any delays tbh
27/08/2020, 13:49 - Paul: all that quick reaction twitch muscle porn
27/08/2020, 13:49 - Wezz: Yeah but their results say:

"The result is that the Logitech mice perform within the ~3~6ms range for click latency, where the Razer mouse performs within the ~9~12ms range for latency.'

Why say some shit broad conclusion instead of focusing on what you actually tested. Surely you get where we're coming from
27/08/2020, 13:49 - Wezz: Mike's coming from his bed
27/08/2020, 13:49 - Wezz: All over his G900
27/08/2020, 13:51 - Mike: The human brain can only see in 15fps so it won't matter
27/08/2020, 13:51 - Paul: It's just being cautious imo. They know and state in the article that it isn't a perfect study, so it's good to be fair and conservative with your conclusion
27/08/2020, 13:51 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
27/08/2020, 13:52 - Paul: Id rather they were cautious than overstate the conclusions üòâ
27/08/2020, 13:52 - Mike: Netflix's Cuties 2: Electric Boogaloo
27/08/2020, 13:52 - Paul: lmao
27/08/2020, 13:52 - Wezz: I wish they focused on the devices they tested.
27/08/2020, 13:54 - Paul: Right so you'd prefer it to say "This mouse has a better input delay than this other mouse, but we didn't test any other ones so literally only this specific one can be shown to be better - in fact, we can't rule out the possibility that this specific mouse itself isn't in some way an outlier even when compared to the same brand mouse, so really this study shows nothing"
27/08/2020, 13:55 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
27/08/2020, 13:59 - Wezz: Nah I'd rather they said:
'Oooo interesting marketing approach Logitech. Nice stand you've got here.' And moved on.

If they're gonna post then state the facts:
'This mouse has better latency than these mice when tested with this equipment because of this new tech.'
27/08/2020, 14:00 - Paul: But they did say that...
27/08/2020, 14:00 - Wezz: But that's my preference. It's like they're scared of a lawsuit the way they talk about it lol
27/08/2020, 14:00 - Paul: They just cant say it's definitively better than all mice
27/08/2020, 14:01 - Paul: It's like a clinical paper, you wouldn't say you've cured cancer, you'd say you trended towards a better prognosis and it's promising for the future
27/08/2020, 14:01 - Wezz: I need to see your CoIs before we discuss any further.
27/08/2020, 14:07 - Wezz: ... of course you don't overstate results. It would be rejected in peer review. I understand your perspective but I think the article is just that, an article. It's shit and I would like to see the latency tests repeated independently but we won't because the actual user benefit is near nil.
27/08/2020, 14:07 - Wezz: But doesn't mean we go around spouting wireless mice have the same latency.
27/08/2020, 14:08 - Wezz: Because BT polling rates, encoding/decoding, all are factors in data transmission for most wireless mice.
27/08/2020, 14:10 - Lockers: Yeah so fuck you Paul
27/08/2020, 14:10 - Wezz: I remember the old PS/2 mice had lower latency than USB due to polling
27/08/2020, 14:10 - Paul: I guess the point they were trying to get across most, which is something I've anecdotally seen agreed fairly unanimously is that at this point the delay is negligible in terms of human perception
27/08/2020, 14:10 - Paul: at least for mice
27/08/2020, 14:11 - Wezz: I 100% agree
27/08/2020, 14:11 - Paul: as we're talking single digit millisecond differences
27/08/2020, 14:11 - Wezz: Not with Bluetooth. It's up to three digits
27/08/2020, 14:12 - Paul: right but with the good ones that use the other thing
27/08/2020, 14:13 - Lockers: No fuck you Paul
27/08/2020, 14:15 - Wezz: Yeah Logitech (and I'm sure some new mice now) using RF can bring that down. I wasn't aware of RF mice so that's my bad
27/08/2020, 14:18 - Wezz: Who knows how those speeds hold up through materials etc. Logitech obv trying to sell their gear. Either way you'll never be Shroud.. even with the better beard

27/08/2020, 14:49 - Wezz: Yeah I've done near zero since covid tbh. Not really into outdoor exercise.. got to do something though
27/08/2020, 14:50 - Lockers: Just a HIIT that my mate has subscribed to and given me his login. As I said it's nothing special and stuff you could easily find on YouTube.
27/08/2020, 14:50 - Wezz: Is it like couch to 5k kinda stuff? 1min run, 1 min walk etc?
27/08/2020, 14:51 - Lockers: That's outside though no? From what I understand it's a bit more intense than that but I've seen people enjoy that couch to 5k thing  who aren't particularly sporty
27/08/2020, 14:52 - Lockers: I fucking hate running for any long period of time so fuck that noise
27/08/2020, 14:53 - Wezz: I did it on treadmill before. Just not ready to gym with a load of sweaty strangers coughing at me
27/08/2020, 14:54 - Lockers: Agreed. I can stand treadmill but just find it so tedious
27/08/2020, 14:55 - Wezz: Kinda want an indoor exercise routine that isn't all burpees until you die..

31/08/2020, 16:55 - Paul: Yeah I get the same thing. If you resist it for an hour or two it dies down after the swim. Drinking lots of water can sate the hunger too. Just gotta be strong it doesn't stay forever üí™üèª

01/09/2020, 11:14 - Derren: Welcome to the new age, don't say anything to anybody because they could take it offensively and then you lose EVERYTHING
01/09/2020, 11:14 - Derren: Also she deserves a slap for saying "not dressed right" üòÇ

01/09/2020, 12:14 - Paul: No it's cool I've got a nandos black card
01/09/2020, 12:19 - Mike: The fact you thought a chicken shop could give you an N-word pass is even more racist
01/09/2020, 12:23 - James: Paul I thought you were woke, but your sleeping harder than anyone else in this chat

02/09/2020, 18:00 - Wezz: I think the word 'good' is understated
02/09/2020, 18:01 - Wezz: Be in the top 0.1% worldwide at a popular game. OR

Gonna get my KKK clothes from the local cornershop.

Love how they put eco-friendly/sustainable before their outright bs lol
03/09/2020, 10:18 - Mike: Well we do the same thing with university admissions and job diversity quotas, this just seems like the same logic applied to commerce
03/09/2020, 10:19 - Paul: Affirmative action can suck my dick
03/09/2020, 10:19 - Mike: I wonder if its possible to study the effects of these kinds of policies, always seemed like taking a sledgehammer to society to solve racism to me
03/09/2020, 10:20 - Paul: They do it with sexism too. Like lowering the fitness standards of firemen because way less women could pass the test
03/09/2020, 10:21 - Mike: Is that actually true? Who could agree to that ü§£
03/09/2020, 10:26 - Paul: https://nypost.com/2014/12/11/fdny-drops-physical-test-requirement-amid-low-female-hiring-rate/
03/09/2020, 10:27 - Paul: Tbf the other source is the daily mail so make of that what you will
03/09/2020, 10:29 - Paul: Pretty sure they do it in the army too. Women require less pull ups in their evaluation
03/09/2020, 10:30 - Mike: Fuck the daily mail. That nypost article is a bit light on details, doesn't mean they reduced requirements specifically to get women into roles ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
03/09/2020, 10:33 - Paul: Yeah I agree not the best sources. It's something I'd definitely heard about a lot. There were at the least, conversations considering it a while back
03/09/2020, 10:34 - Noone: I've managed to convince our tech architect to name our new search microservice "Galactus" after this video https://youtu.be/y8OnoxKotPQ
03/09/2020, 10:34 - Noone: This is the most impact I'll have on this company, and I'm fine with that
03/09/2020, 10:37 - James: I remember this as well, but we might have had a discussion about it a few years ago so could be moot
03/09/2020, 10:37 - James: I know what that's going to be without clicking it and I'm very proud of you
03/09/2020, 10:39 - Paul: Lmao that was great
03/09/2020, 10:43 - Mike: The non-technical guy's facial expressions as the dude is explaining is my favourite part, half "oh no, thats bad" half "I could not care less"
03/09/2020, 10:44 - Paul: And half pig
03/09/2020, 12:04 - Wezz: They're so many examples. I liked the orchestra approach. Where they fought really hard for blind auditions to combat suspected sexism and racism. Was granted, started putting up big shields in front of performers. Then the representation grew FURTHER from societal quotas and they now did a 180 and want it abolished üòèüòè I love meritocracy

Tiny summary with sources:
https://slippedisc.com/2020/07/ny-times-turns-tail-on-blind-auditions/

I also use *they* loosely.. probably all different people
03/09/2020, 12:11 - Wezz: I wish they'd just own up and say:
_"We want this group to be more accurately representative of society, AS A PRIORITY, over *every* other factor. E.g. competence, work ethic..."_

In some cases this can actually be an okay approach...e.g we use it for PPIE or Ethics groups in community healthcare. Still makes me feel dirty though. You're here primarily cause of your ethnicity, secondary to your intelligence. Oof
03/09/2020, 12:15 - Wezz: People utilise it in academia because it's directly tied to the likelihood of receiving funding.

People use it in commercial sector to virtue signal and slip under societal backlash/cancel culture lol.
03/09/2020, 12:15 - Wezz: Spent 15 minutes pooing and writing üëå
03/09/2020, 12:16 - Mike: Don't forget the free publicity, which is the main reason I'd argue at least commercially
03/09/2020, 12:16 - Wezz: Yeah very true. Genuine question. You're in charge of ¬£1mil marketing budget.
03/09/2020, 12:18 - Wezz: What approach do you use to improve public image?
- Enforce quotas, employ less competent staff, and push the message of equity?
- charitable donation
03/09/2020, 12:19 - Wezz: I'd take 2 all day. I think 1 is kinda 'expected' in today's world. 2 is always seen as altruistic
03/09/2020, 12:41 - James: I keep the money and ask my friends to post positive reviews on google
03/09/2020, 12:43 - Paul: I stop pretending to care about public image like nestle and amazon
03/09/2020, 12:56 - James: I'd give Paul ¬£30 to get him to parade the streets of New York saying how my company changed his life
03/09/2020, 12:56 - Mike: Donate to charities which promote the cause, claim both and the tax write off
03/09/2020, 13:02 - Mike: Its an interesting one for sure, centuries previous racism/sexism/classism has reduced representation and prospects for people. How do we solve? Simple and shit "solution" is this reverse racism we see now named affirmative action.. but I can't think of another simplistic and actionable solution
03/09/2020, 13:04 - Mike: imo we go the propaganda route, nationalise hollywood and mandate representation for everyone there. That way we only fuck over one industry, anyway vote for #Mike2020
03/09/2020, 13:20 - Wezz: Lol, yeah this weird regressive racism is actually flying with some people.

IMO if you privilege people based on race/sex you're back to square one. Reparations sound cool and alleviate guilt but they don't end there, they legitimise the far right, and the whole thing eventually eats itself. The same thing happened in 60's with black power/black beauty movements.

Saying these imbalances of race/sex representation are due to -isms, and ignoring the many other factors at play; is hugely simplifying the issue. Categorising as 'systemic racism' achieves the same.
03/09/2020, 13:23 - Wezz: But also yeah, let's quota up everything, fuck it. Punish the Asians for what the whites did to the blacks. Roundabout of fuckery lol

05/09/2020, 10:19 - Mike: Venezuelans are taking over runescape worlds and protecting gold farmers from player killers. If a person who's paying protection is attacked, hundreds of Venezuelans log into that world and defend them. The gold farmers are farming an estimated 72Billion gold a day across all worlds, impacting the runescape economy.
05/09/2020, 10:19 - Mike: We live in wild times

05/09/2020, 12:21 - Derren: It's not even the Devs
05/09/2020, 12:21 - Derren: There's fuck tons of content or has been about "taking out venezuelan gold farmers"
05/09/2020, 12:21 - Derren: and it's just streams/vids of pkers specifically hunting the gold farmers
05/09/2020, 12:22 - Derren: Must be so funny to have 1-5k subs and people donating to you constantly killing people just trying to make money to survive
05/09/2020, 12:26 - Mike: "No dinner today son, twitch streamer l33tzor camped my farming spot and made sure I made nothing"

It's only been 10 years, but League are gonna redesign items/shop. Looks WEIRD
09/09/2020, 18:06 - Mike: taking a look now but if its anything like the rest of the UI they should just burn it all and start again
09/09/2020, 18:07 - Wezz: Looks like it was made by an artist with zero UI experience tbh. love how a significant pat on the back they give themselves is for adding a 'ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO BAN THIS CHAMP YOUR TEAMMATE WANTS TO PLAY?' confirmation box.
09/09/2020, 18:07 - Wezz: Just embarrassing company. can you go get employed there and fix it please

09/09/2020, 18:15 - Mike: why can you ban a hero your team mate wants to play in the first place? could just remove the option right?
09/09/2020, 18:16 - Wezz: Maybe for Bard River players...

10/09/2020, 11:25 - Wezz: How many average dicks could you fit in an average sized letter box?
10/09/2020, 11:26 - Paul: Average dick is 10 inches right?
10/09/2020, 11:27 - Mike: Lol only 10 this ain't Asia RIGHT GUYS?
10/09/2020, 11:28 - Mike: "According to new research published in the¬†British Journal of Urology, there is an average size when it comes to the male genitalia. Using data taken from a number of studies that had looked at 15,521 different men, the study found that the average length of a flaccid penis is 3.6 inches (9.16 cm, and 5.2 inches when stretched and still flaccid) while the average length of an erect penis is 5.2 inches (13.12 cm)."
10/09/2020, 11:29 - Mike: Kirk, what's your standard letter box opening size?
10/09/2020, 11:29 - Wezz: 15.521 men stretched their flaccid penises next to a ruler.
10/09/2020, 11:29 - Dayle: yes im normal with somthing atleast!
10/09/2020, 11:29 - Wezz: Same stretch flaccid length as erect. Interesting.
10/09/2020, 11:32 - Kirky: About 2 fingers
10/09/2020, 11:34 - Paul: That first sentence seems redundant? Like... of course there's an average
10/09/2020, 11:36 - Mike: Hypothesis. Dong length will grow to fill stretched skin, if we simply stretch the skin dong will grow to fill. Who's up for stretching their skin everyday for science?
10/09/2020, 11:37 - Paul: Welcome to the science of jelqing
10/09/2020, 11:38 - Mike: I had to Google that, wtf
10/09/2020, 11:39 - Paul: I remember it from being 15 and wanting a massive dong. Tried it for like 2 days and peaced out
10/09/2020, 11:42 - Kirky: It's legit right ? But need to do it like every day for a long time

10/09/2020, 13:04 - Derren: They aren't fishing a fedex account lol
10/09/2020, 13:04 - Derren: they probably want you to enter payment details
10/09/2020, 13:05 - Mike: Ah right, why would they need payment details to confirm an address? Thats a bit blatant
10/09/2020, 13:10 - Derren: I'm just assuming
10/09/2020, 13:10 - Derren: normally if you order stuff from abroad, you do it without paying import fees/vat
10/09/2020, 13:10 - Wezz: Maybe...probably identify theft (after name/address) and then payment after that for the dumb dumbs
10/09/2020, 13:10 - Derren: But if it gets caught in customs you need to pay the fees
10/09/2020, 13:17 - Mike: Either way you better enter your details, don't want to miss your item

13/09/2020, 20:17 - Kirky: #BLM #ACAB
13/09/2020, 20:50 - Noone: LOL
13/09/2020, 20:53 - Wezz: I heard she was praying at the time
13/09/2020, 20:56 - Kirky: her boyfriend shot at the cops first right? i cant remember

13/09/2020, 22:01 - Kirky: Easily atleast in my top 5 dumbest things I've cooked
13/09/2020, 22:01 - Kirky: They're not thick enough so cutting them in half is a nightmare
13/09/2020, 22:01 - Paul: Gonna need that top 5 run down
13/09/2020, 22:01 - Mike: Perfect halloween bake
13/09/2020, 22:04 - Wezz: mate, just put the cream and jam on top fuck it

13/09/2020, 22:05 - Wezz: JUST BLEND IT UP AND PUT IT IN MY VEINS
13/09/2020, 22:34 - Kirky: The jam isnt thick enough either and the buttercream icing is TOO thick so it's all just awkward and messy as fuck lmfao

13/09/2020, 23:52 - Wezz: i mean, that cheese shard thing can fuck off
13/09/2020, 23:53 - Wezz: then can't really see the rest, but the bottom bit (below the cheese shard) looks kinda like a burger, I'll keep that.
13/09/2020, 23:54 - Wezz: May as well put the flora butter box in there while you're at it, some foil. The plate.
14/09/2020, 07:20 - Kirky: You're both wrong

14/09/2020, 16:24 - Derren: German email address
14/09/2020, 16:37 - Mike: Yeh this guy doesn't understand that you can in fact pass on human bias into an algorithm if you train it incorrectly which is the points these articles are trying to raise, assuming they're talking about supervised learning algorithms (which the 2nd article mentions but he glosses over quite quickly)
14/09/2020, 16:38 - Mike: although I'd have no trouble believing some cultures are more racist/sexist than others, thats kind of a given right?
14/09/2020, 16:44 - Wezz: Oh sweet, must be Nathans NestMini arriving at yours. Don't be selfish, pay the custom charge
14/09/2020, 16:46 - Wezz: Totally. Seen plenty of real life examples of groups going from 'normal' to racist as a result of immigration. Kent has a few towns that spring to mind.
14/09/2020, 16:48 - Wezz: In London though, my own experience has been that minorities are more racist than 'natives'. Not bothered to back it when any polls or whatever. It's a sensitive topic that's poorly understood at the best of times. Just from my interactions with different backgrounds.
14/09/2020, 16:49 - Wezz: *with any polls.
14/09/2020, 16:49 - Wezz: Everyone knows racist don't answer polls... Too busy knitting swastikas
14/09/2020, 16:58 - Wezz: People do tend to shoo these groups without thinking. They're often directly dispossessed by immigration (lower wages/higher competition/whatever), then become quietly bitter and resentful, mixed with small town culture shock, can no longer provide for their families like they used to, AND THEN they get told they're foaming at the mouth racists by (sometimes) privileged kids working in the IT industry. Good way to segregate the lunatics and validate their pariahdom.

Doesn't he'll that they're mostly uncultured small-town manual labor workers.
14/09/2020, 16:59 - Wezz: *doesn't help
14/09/2020, 17:00 - Wezz: Sorry, end of the day, somewhat off-topic rant.

15/09/2020, 16:16 - Dayle: only found out recently japans age of consent is 13 that is actually fucked up
15/09/2020, 16:17 - Mike: Vatican's is 12 iirc
15/09/2020, 16:18 - Mike: and you know what they say, what happens in the Vatican stays in the Vatican

15/09/2020, 16:19 - Mike: What else they supposed to do? Wait until they're teenagers? pfft
15/09/2020, 16:47 - James: I think this is one of those urban legends, it is, but only on one specific island if there is a super specific circumstance
15/09/2020, 16:48 - Dayle: Google it lol
15/09/2020, 17:03 - James: Yeah, it's sixteen in Japan unless the relationship is specifically approved as there not being a power imbalance
15/09/2020, 17:03 - James: Which in most cases there will be
15/09/2020, 17:50 - Wezz: Do relatives count? Asking for a father
15/09/2020, 17:53 - James: Did somebody say wincest?

15/09/2020, 18:07 - Paul: don't you think so?

15/09/2020, 18:10 - Wezz: Can see how that'd be misconstrued
15/09/2020, 18:49 - Derren: Go to the Vatican you can fuck an 11 year old

17/09/2020, 15:00 - Paul: Links like this should be illegal
17/09/2020, 15:18 - Wezz: So there're 89 characters between _v1._ and _/giphy.gif_
Assuming they're using Uppercase, Lowercase and Numbers. That's 26+26+10=62 possible alphanumeric options.
62 options ^ 89 characters = 3.33319227E159 possibilities

Or:
3,333,192,269,999,999,976,008,440,816,728,936,112,328,888,128,888,752,328,016,888,472,464,776,808,240,960,392,512,288,528,704,944,560,240,664,056,256,120,928,288,304,928,800,088,368,320,104,976,888,256,256,360,024 possibilities.
17/09/2020, 15:19 - Paul: How bored are you
17/09/2020, 15:26 - Mike: waste of storage space, designer should be shot, hung, and quartered
17/09/2020, 15:29 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
17/09/2020, 15:31 - Wezz: I have no idea how big numbers work... just baffles me tbh
17/09/2020, 15:32 - Paul: Grahams number
17/09/2020, 15:35 - Mike: Once you get to that large a number you just give up and die
17/09/2020, 15:36 - Wezz: Not sure why, but those numbers don't interest me as much. They're cool but more about known limitations. Whereas 52factorial and permutations of real world things I find super interesting.
17/09/2020, 15:36 - Paul: Infinity +1
17/09/2020, 15:37 - James: 69
17/09/2020, 15:37 - Wezz: Like, the 52 factorial descriptions are awesome and relatable, because everyone's handled a deck of cards before.
17/09/2020, 15:40 - Wezz: For anyone interested:
52 factorial is: 80658175170943878571660636856403766975289505440883277824000000000000, which is the number of ways an ordinary deck of cards can be shuffled.

Start by picking your favorite spot on the equator. You're going to walk around the world along the equator, but take a very leisurely pace of one step every billion years. The equatorial circumference of the Earth is 40,075,017 meters. Make sure to pack a deck of playing cards, so you can get in a few trillion hands of solitaire between steps. After you complete your round the world trip, remove one drop of water from the Pacific Ocean. Now do the same thing again: walk around the world at one billion years per step, removing one drop of water from the Pacific Ocean each time you circle the globe. The Pacific Ocean contains 707.6 million cubic kilometers of water. Continue until the ocean is empty. When it is, take one sheet of paper and place it flat on the ground. Now, fill the ocean back up and start the entire process all over again, adding a sheet of paper to the stack each time you've emptied the ocean.

Do this until the stack of paper reaches from the Earth to the Sun. Take a glance at the timer, you will see that the three left-most digits haven't even changed. You still have 8.063e67 more seconds to go. 1 Astronomical Unit, the distance from the Earth to the Sun, is defined as 149,597,870.691 kilometers. So, take the stack of papers down and do it all over again. One thousand times more. Unfortunately, that still won't do it. There are still more than 5.385e67 seconds remaining. You're just about a third of the way done.

To pass the remaining time, start shuffling your deck of cards. Every billion years deal yourself a 5-card poker hand. Each time you get a royal flush, buy yourself a lottery ticket. A royal flush occurs in one out of every 649,740 hands. If that ticket wins the jackpot, throw a grain of sand into the Grand Canyon. Keep going and when you've filled up the canyon with sand, remove one ounce of rock from Mt. Everest. Now empty the canyon and start all over again. When you've leveled Mt. Everest, look at the timer, you still have 5.364e67 seconds remaining. Mt. Everest weighs about 357 trillion pounds. You barely made a dent. If you were to repeat this 255 times, you would still be looking at 3.024e64 seconds. The timer would finally reach zero sometime during your 256th attempt.
17/09/2020, 15:53 - Mike: yeh but I shuffle quite fast
17/09/2020, 15:53 - Mike: does that help?
17/09/2020, 15:53 - James: I can't even read all of that without getting bored, let alone actually do it
17/09/2020, 17:24 - Wezz: I missed the intro:
52 factorial is beyond astronomically large. I say beyond astronomically large because most numbers that we already consider to be astronomically large are mere infinitesimal fractions of this number. So, just how large is it? Let's try to wrap our puny human brains around the magnitude of this number with a fun little theoretical exercise. Start a timer that will count down the number of seconds from 52! to 0. We're going to see how much fun we can have before the timer counts down all the way.
17/09/2020, 17:27 - James: My timer doesn't go that high
17/09/2020, 17:30 - Wezz: What's the largest timer you can set?
17/09/2020, 17:30 - Wezz: I'm definitely bored.
17/09/2020, 17:32 - James: 100 hours, 40 minutes, 39 seconds
17/09/2020, 17:33 - Wezz: Is that a stopwatch-esk timer?
17/09/2020, 17:33 - James: Yeah
17/09/2020, 17:33 - Wezz: Like, it counts DOWN
17/09/2020, 17:33 - James: Countdown timer
17/09/2020, 17:33 - Wezz: I seeeee.
17/09/2020, 17:33 - James: It's 99:99:99
17/09/2020, 17:33 - Wezz: Mine is 23:59:59
17/09/2020, 17:34 - James: You have android?
17/09/2020, 17:34 - Wezz: Feel like a second class citizen

30/09/2020, 06:57 - Paul: https://mobile.twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1311131311965306885
30/09/2020, 06:58 - Paul: Ok I didn't watch the debates but I wake up and trump has an armyfortrump website and is calling for his followers to watch the polls. If that's not alarming I don't know what is
30/09/2020, 06:59 - Lockers: After only briefly browsing reddit, trump seemed to have dun goofed
30/09/2020, 06:59 - Qck: I think I suffered from a stroke halfway through so missed some vital stuff
30/09/2020, 07:00 - Paul: From the highlights I've seen I don't blame you
30/09/2020, 07:00 - Qck: JK I stayed up until 7am watching CNBC, FOX and ABC like a true patriot
30/09/2020, 07:01 - Paul: So Biden started bad but finished strong from what I'm reading. Better than I'd hoped for but still no Bernie
30/09/2020, 07:01 - Qck: Watch it instead of reading how bout dah
30/09/2020, 07:02 - Paul: Would you say that's inaccurate?
30/09/2020, 07:02 - Lockers: On YouTube yet?
30/09/2020, 07:02 - Qck: It was broadcast on YouTube
30/09/2020, 07:03 - Lockers: Oh, furry muff
30/09/2020, 07:03 - Qck: Yeah probably, flashes of insight from Joe with actual stats every so often but it was a shitshow throughout really
30/09/2020, 07:04 - Qck: The amount of times Biden would start listing his points by numbering them and then forget which number he was on due to Donnys interruptions
30/09/2020, 07:04 - Paul: "Only time trump shut up was when he was asked to condemn white supremacy"
30/09/2020, 07:04 - Qck: https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/j29i27/2020_first_us_presidential_debate_real_time_fact
30/09/2020, 07:04 - Qck: Is a good thread to have opened as you deal with the hour long slurry of garbage tv
30/09/2020, 07:04 - Paul: Yeah thanks that's what I wanted
30/09/2020, 07:04 - Qck: *open - it's getting late and I'm sleep now
30/09/2020, 07:05 - Paul: I mean this has to be a tactic to set off his stutter right
30/09/2020, 07:05 - Paul: Just frustrate him
30/09/2020, 07:07 - Qck: Yah and also because Donny doesn't/can't prepare for a debate
30/09/2020, 07:07 - Paul: Doesn't need to. He could shit on the stage and his 38% base wouldn't shift
30/09/2020, 07:08 - Qck: My opinion is that his base will love it but swing voters, protest voters and whatever level headed republicans that are left will turn heel
30/09/2020, 07:09 - Paul: Which must say more about Biden. Trump was just regular trump so I doubt he'll turn any heads. No one is forming new opinions on him lol
30/09/2020, 07:10 - Qck: Trump is normally regular Trump in a vacuum though
30/09/2020, 07:11 - Paul: Yeah true if you put someone more stable next to him the contrast is staggering
30/09/2020, 08:48 - Wezz: Respect cause that was a trainwreck
30/09/2020, 08:49 - Wezz: Biden actually did pretty well all things considered. Moderation was shit
30/09/2020, 08:53 - Wezz: I liked when Biden spoke to me. Felt like my dying grandad. I'd probably vote for him
30/09/2020, 09:06 - Noone: Watching the highlights now and they both sound utterly retarded
30/09/2020, 09:21 - Wezz: They both have moments of absolute retardation. But watching the whole thing actually reveals a lot. Both strawmanning the rich yet they're millionaires.

Biden reciting to the audience was touching, then trump going mad child mode adhominem, touching on corruption and lies that are going on behind the scenes. Undoubtedly some is true which brings back to: you can't trust politicians.
30/09/2020, 09:22 - Wezz: It's the ciiiiiirrrrccclee of life
30/09/2020, 09:57 - Paul: Going after his kids was a low blow. If Biden wanted, he could destroy trump by discussing his family. So much projection
30/09/2020, 09:58 - Wezz: Meh, I like having no rules at these things. Poor Biden handled it well, "I'm proud of my son".
30/09/2020, 09:59 - Noone: Too bad the over sixties aren't proud of his disgusting crackhead son
30/09/2020, 09:59 - Paul: Right it's fine if it were in any way relevant. Look at trumps kids. Even more shitty and even more irrelevant
30/09/2020, 10:00 - Noone: Bidens got one crackhead son and one who died of a brain tumor. Coincidence?
30/09/2020, 10:03 - Wezz: It worked a little for me. Cause Biden was tickling my balls and talking to me, I was about to come and then trump says "his unemployed crackhead son took 3.5m from China with no previous industrial experience" and I went flaccid.
30/09/2020, 10:04 - Noone: Bidens got lovely hairy legs and the kids love to play with his hair legs under the water in the pool
30/09/2020, 10:04 - Paul: "Dude your son is literally being indicted and prosecuted by the new York state"
30/09/2020, 10:05 - Paul: "And your evidence against hunter is dogshit"
30/09/2020, 10:06 - Noone: <Media omitted>
30/09/2020, 10:06 - Noone: "nom"
30/09/2020, 10:06 - Wezz: That's what I looked like when he spoke to my soul
30/09/2020, 10:06 - Noone: Biden taking a bite out of your rights!
30/09/2020, 10:08 - Wezz: Also at the end the frat guys memeing "best president ever Donald Trump! Wooo" sums up US politics lol

When is it not black history month? Oh and customary "racisms over!"
30/09/2020, 10:09 - Wezz: I always thought they were red so they were easier to see.. what do I know.
30/09/2020, 10:11 - Noone: Also, Patel considering making an island in the Atlantic a migrant processing facility. Like Australia but thousands of miles away from the mainland
30/09/2020, 10:22 - Kirky: A e s t h e t i c
30/09/2020, 10:27 - Mike: So is Royal Mail red because post boxes were red, or are post boxes red cos royal mail red?
30/09/2020, 10:29 - Wezz: Sorry, I think it was the availability of blood from our ancestors' black slaves.
30/09/2020, 10:29 - Noone: Post boxes are red because that's the colour of postman's blood and in the olden days postmen would have to fight their way through the streets of London. painting the boxes red was a way to prevent bloody handprints deterring people from wanting to send their post
30/09/2020, 10:30 - Mike: <Media omitted>
30/09/2020, 10:30 - Wezz: You been reported!? lool i've never seen that

30/09/2020, 10:33 - Paul: Watching the debates now. Needs a gif of that "let me finish" Canadian guy from South Park
30/09/2020, 10:33 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
30/09/2020, 10:35 - James: There isn't really a reason beyond personal preferences of the people in charge. Post boxes were originally a dark green, and dusted with bronze powder to look elegant, and that lasted about 25 years. Eventually, in 1874, a post office official told the contractor general and post controller that the green colour made them look horrible and moldy, and requested a nice red instead, and so that just became the standard.
30/09/2020, 10:36 - Paul: Well now I've got 2 conflicting origin stories and I don't know what to believe. We need a Jack and James debate
30/09/2020, 10:36 - Mike: wait, so when I dust myself with bronze you saying I look mouldy?
30/09/2020, 10:37 - James: Only when you paint yourself dark green first
30/09/2020, 10:37 - Noone: No no Mike you look lovely!
_James seriously, he doesn't need this right now_
30/09/2020, 10:38 - Wezz: The bronzer really brings out the mould in your eyes
30/09/2020, 10:39 - James: _Jack, come on, are we just going to let him do this to himself?_

30/09/2020, 10:40 - Derren: HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THIS?
30/09/2020, 10:45 - Mike: You guys seen the subreddit drama about the Vyoutuber that was looking at her subs google analytics and mentioned Thaiwan was their 3rd most viewing country, queue army of mainland chinesers calling for her cancellation
30/09/2020, 10:45 - Mike: thats the gist I got from it anyway
30/09/2020, 11:05 - James: Gold postboxes are to commemorate gold winners at the Olympics and Paralympics
30/09/2020, 11:06 - Derren: This James kid knows too much
30/09/2020, 11:06 - Derren: Gonna need to get him killed
30/09/2020, 11:06 - James: There is also 5 blue postboxes for the NHS, but that was more recent
30/09/2020, 11:08 - James: You can also tell how old a postbox is by the Regalia stamp on the front, the rarest being Edward VIIIs regalia, as he had a short reign
30/09/2020, 11:16 - Qck: Wanna play with my hair legs later
30/09/2020, 11:16 - Kirky: Hey James I'm meant to be the expert here please shut up
30/09/2020, 11:17 - Paul: Ah the classic Biden move
30/09/2020, 11:18 - Qck: In a line-up of faces James definitely has the "I'm a post office historian" look to him
30/09/2020, 11:19 - Qck: Kirky you have the anime masturbator look covered so why can't you just be happy for once
30/09/2020, 11:21 - Paul: Whereas Sam has the wearing his victims skin look locked down
30/09/2020, 11:22 - Noone: YOU HAVE A SHORT REIGN HAHAA
30/09/2020, 11:24 - James: I'm strangely touched, though probably not the first time you've been told that...
30/09/2020, 11:24 - James: Fuck you, you fucking horrible little piece of shit
30/09/2020, 11:25 - James: Why the fuck would you say that?
30/09/2020, 11:25 - Noone: Yeah qck goes for the rape victims
30/09/2020, 11:28 - Nathan: Also all the post boxes and telephone boxes in Hull are in a cream colouring and not the traditional red
30/09/2020, 11:29 - Nathan: And Kingston communication is the only service provider for phone lines and Internet
30/09/2020, 11:29 - Qck: Keep going I'm almost there
30/09/2020, 11:30 - James: Because Hull are control friends and HCPD decided they didn't want to be red, and didn't want to show a crown (because fuck the monarchy). HCPD eventually became KCOM.
30/09/2020, 11:30 - James: control freaks*
30/09/2020, 11:52 - Kirky: <Media omitted>
30/09/2020, 12:13 - Paul: Ok so just finished the debate. All the people saying they were both terrible and equally bad are just pure talking crap. Biden was at worst ok. Bit of stammering and a few gaffs but genuinely heartfelt and had great points and detailed a lot of issues and how he will address them. Trump was a bonafide fucking retard who would not stop talking and barely once made a coherent point. His biggest win was arguing that Biden signed the tax bill that lead to his smart choice of not paying taxes. (Great job at best that just means you both suck) but Biden refuted that. I'd need to look in to it.

That whole thing was a fucking tragedy and it wasn't because of Biden
30/09/2020, 12:23 - Noone: Interesting take
30/09/2020, 12:24 - Paul: I'd be concerned for anyone genuinely coming away with anything else
30/09/2020, 12:25 - Noone: We know you would be, dw
30/09/2020, 12:26 - Paul: Bear in mind I said genuinely not just to be edgy/contrarian
30/09/2020, 12:27 - Noone: <Media omitted>
30/09/2020, 12:38 - Wezz: this statement is everything wrong with current democrats LOL
30/09/2020, 12:38 - Paul: Damn must have missed that part of the debate... and I watched so closely
30/09/2020, 12:38 - Paul: I don't even 1% support Joe Biden so we're clear
30/09/2020, 12:38 - Noone: Do you condem white supremacists? (General label for groups of people who subscribe to racist ideas)
Trump's response was we need to do something about antifa (literal organisation of people)
biden responds "antifa is an idea, not an organisation"
30/09/2020, 12:39 - Paul: And I'm on record months ago saying I thought he'd get destroyed in the debates
30/09/2020, 12:39 - Wezz: Well it's everything wrong with politics too. "you can't have a different view from ME AND MY GROUP" hurrr durr
30/09/2020, 12:39 - Wezz: literal polarising mentality.
30/09/2020, 12:40 - Wezz: we're so inclusive, but if you think differently UH OH
30/09/2020, 12:40 - Noone: I think Bernie would have done a fantastic job against Trump in that debate
30/09/2020, 12:41 - Noone: Why they wheeled that blubbering, drooling retard on stage and to the front of the Democratic party I have no idea
30/09/2020, 12:41 - Paul: This isn't even politics either. Trump literally reduced it to shouting. It was a pure embarrassment and people trying to frame them as equally at fault are just fucking wrong it's not an opinion
30/09/2020, 12:42 - Noone: >it's not an opinion
Oh I see, you've boiled it down to pure mathematics cool
30/09/2020, 12:42 - Noone: Show your working or you won't get all 6 marks, right Lockers?
30/09/2020, 12:43 - Paul: People have literally done the maths on his number of interruptions
30/09/2020, 12:43 - Wezz: if you're talking about discourse i'd agree
30/09/2020, 12:43 - Wezz: but you weren't in your first comment
30/09/2020, 12:43 - Wezz: so w/e, backtrack away lol
30/09/2020, 12:44 - Paul: Yes I was. He was shouting and wouldn't stop talking and it was just nonsense to do with different topics. Which the host had to remind him like 50 times
30/09/2020, 12:44 - Paul: "We'll  get to that. We've already talked about that"
30/09/2020, 12:44 - Paul: Constantly
30/09/2020, 12:45 - Wezz: lol same thing happened to biden imo
30/09/2020, 12:45 - Wezz: talking about random stuff, moderator had to put him back on track at least twice
30/09/2020, 12:46 - Paul: Yeah about 5 times. I just watched the whole thing
30/09/2020, 12:46 - Wezz: sad thing, is the divisiveness of politics is still having an affect on those who consume it
30/09/2020, 12:46 - Noone: I mean Trump didn't really divert much from his usual bullshit, but I hoped biden would at least flat out embarrass him and put up decent arguments, but he just floundered in the face of Trump's easily countered points
30/09/2020, 12:46 - Paul: You lose count of how many times it happened with trump
30/09/2020, 12:47 - Paul: Yeah Bernie would have crushed him for sure. But it's not like he didn't have the talking points. He specifically said he didn't want to bring up trumps family and ethics even though he could.
30/09/2020, 12:48 - Paul: Trump made a mockery of even his own positions because of his inability to  be civil and play fair. I don't understand how anyone can say it was equally both of them who saw the debate.
30/09/2020, 12:49 - Wezz: it obviously depends on what domain you're judging them on
30/09/2020, 12:49 - Noone: Has the Bern's Unit subsided to identify politics ? I haven't heard his stance on it
30/09/2020, 12:49 - Paul: On their debating skills I guess?
30/09/2020, 12:49 - Paul: Not sure what that is
30/09/2020, 12:50 - Noone: The debating skills of Trump are shite, but to not be able to flat out win against that means Biden isn't much better. Both useless just for different reasons
30/09/2020, 12:51 - Paul: I completely agree. But the narrative I'm seeing from a lot of "I'm above all these idiots" people is that they were both equally ruining the debate. Which just isn't true
30/09/2020, 12:51 - Wezz: 100% biden was civil and reasonable and actually had some appeal. but the point is not everyone is judging based on those factors
30/09/2020, 12:52 - Paul: I don't think the other factors had a chance to come in to play when it was completely derailed
30/09/2020, 12:53 - Paul: The biggest headlines I'm seeing are zingers telling him to shut up
30/09/2020, 12:53 - Paul: Like great good job. But why was that necessary
30/09/2020, 12:53 - Wezz: Well for you to say "anyone who thinks different from me is wrong" is literally what got them into this dichotomy mess.
30/09/2020, 12:54 - Noone: Yeah it's all Paul's fault! GET HIM
30/09/2020, 12:55 - Paul: If you think both Biden and Trump are equally at fault for the debate being shit and embarrassing then you are wrong and I'll die on that hill.
30/09/2020, 12:55 - Wezz: well now you've been more specific i can agree
30/09/2020, 12:55 - Paul: I feel like I said that from the start
30/09/2020, 12:55 - Wezz: amazing what some specificity can do in avoiding civil war lol
30/09/2020, 12:55 - Noone: I'll fix this for you:
"...then I think you are wrong..."
30/09/2020, 12:55 - Wezz: i mean read this and tell me that
30/09/2020, 12:56 - Paul: The first comment is addressing people saying they were both equally bad. And then I said why it's untrue
30/09/2020, 12:57 - Paul: Nah it's objective super truth the highest one
30/09/2020, 12:57 - Noone: We're arguing over which kid with down syndrome will eat his Lego set the fastest.
Dems saw they were up against Trump for re-election, so they chose a shit candidate and now try and dress him up. Republicans should win just to punish the Dems for making such a retarded decision
30/09/2020, 12:58 - Paul: Right But I wasn't arguing any of that. Just that trump ruined the debate not both of them and they weren't equally bad
30/09/2020, 12:58 - Paul: They both suck so we're clear
30/09/2020, 12:58 - Noone: Inconsiquential ultimately when all you can get out of it is one retard wins and the other retard doesnt
30/09/2020, 12:59 - Wezz: "disruption" instead of "bad" and "terrible" would work. but yeah cool i get your review
30/09/2020, 13:00 - Wezz: it's all bullshit and i am checking out on politics for my own sanity, feel like it's playground games at this point
30/09/2020, 13:00 - Noone: Let's just hope the winning retard doesnt bow to the children rioting in communities cos of "muh skin colour"
30/09/2020, 13:00 - Paul: Yeah sure sorry if that was poorly worded
30/09/2020, 13:03 - Paul: I saw you typing Mike don't hide
30/09/2020, 13:06 - James: Can't we just use this as an opportunity to pretend to have a high horse in the UK before Furher Boris blocks us thinking about foreigners?
30/09/2020, 13:07 - Paul: Literally the UK debates are like mensa compared to that
30/09/2020, 13:12 - Mike: Can't comment, haven't watched :( not like these debates matter
30/09/2020, 13:13 - Mike: confirms what we know, Joe is old, Trump is a minecraft slime escaped from the computer
30/09/2020, 13:14 - Paul: Tell my wife I said hello
30/09/2020, 13:14 - Noone: Good old Middling Mike strikes again
30/09/2020, 13:14 - Noone: Fucking centrists
30/09/2020, 13:14 - Paul: He's honestly the worst
30/09/2020, 13:14 - Paul: We can all agree
30/09/2020, 13:15 - Noone: Anyone who disagrees is gsnuinely a Mike, and I'll die on that Mike.
30/09/2020, 13:15 - Noone: Mike Mike Mike Mike
30/09/2020, 13:15 - Paul: Mike you're so FRUSTRATINGLY NEUTRAL with a heart full of neutrality
30/09/2020, 13:15 - Noone: Until he loses at a viddy game he thinks he's good at
30/09/2020, 13:16 - Mike: I'm decidedly not neutral, I think Trump is a moron
30/09/2020, 13:16 - Paul: Haha that's an L for Jack. USA USA USA
30/09/2020, 13:16 - Mike: I don't see career politicians as necessarily bad, but times are what they are
30/09/2020, 13:17 - Mike: DRAIN THE SWAMP

30/09/2020, 13:56 - James: Well well well

30/09/2020, 13:57 - James: Thanks for stopping by!
30/09/2020, 14:28 - Paul: I don't hate Jack he's the joker to my batman. The burger king to my McDonald's. The shark to my cool fonzie jet ski trick.

30/09/2020, 15:03 - James: Bake him? That's exactly what Hitler used to say
30/09/2020, 15:03 - James: Get him boys
30/09/2020, 15:52 - Derren: Referring to Jack as Joker is giving him more credit than he should be given

30/09/2020, 18:35 - Paul: Although it does disprove this. So I take this back

30/09/2020, 19:13 - Mike: pretty funny news org reactions
30/09/2020, 19:17 - Mike: I watched the debate, got about 30 mins in and felt like it was an absolute waste of time. Trump's usual floundering, Biden's appeal to emotions throughout pissed me off as well. Overall Biden looked more favourable but not enough as I'd hoped. Election day is gonna become a civil war at this rate

02/10/2020, 21:08 - Kirky: im watching from when noel fielding first joined, i havent seen it before
02/10/2020, 21:08 - James: Same

02/10/2020, 21:12 - James: That's why you're not invited Kirky
02/10/2020, 21:13 - James: It's because it's super low stakes
02/10/2020, 21:13 - James: Pretty sure there is no prize
02/10/2020, 21:13 - Kirky: oh really? whats the point

02/10/2020, 21:30 - James: You're true
02/10/2020, 21:30 - Kirky: thanks
02/10/2020, 21:33 - James: How true do you think they actually are with their bake off intros? Do you think you could get them to broadcast
"Sam enjoys his rainy days as a postman, but between that and baking, he enjoys imagining spending days with 2D waifus and hating strangers playing vidya on the internet."
02/10/2020, 21:35 - James: "James is an NPC by day, but between allowing players to browse his wares, and opening quest lines for new adventures, he has been perfecting his family sweet roll recipe"
02/10/2020, 21:39 - Lockers: Hey @447835575116 is this a Simpsons reference?
02/10/2020, 21:40 - Paul: Hey @447758520258 eat a bag a shit

02/10/2020, 21:41 - Kirky: "he likes to bake for his coworkers, but only a few of them because half of them are cunts"
02/10/2020, 21:46 - Noone: let's Among us

06/10/2020, 14:22 - Dayle: One step at a time to change the world ;) üí™
06/10/2020, 14:41 - Wezz: Mate, was expecting you to make an appearance... genuinely would be very helpful to have GP records available at Tertiary hospitals. Currently depend on GP Logs/Summaries. Saves trawling through a lifetime of GP records though.
06/10/2020, 14:47 - Dayle: Yeah one hospital at at time we are making waves :) whole of Kent, and Greater Manchester, Bristol etc hopefully coming to London soon
06/10/2020, 14:55 - Wezz: Some serious üí∞üí∞üí∞ in it if you can do it successfully in London. Problem is all regions use different systems; different GP systems AND specialised requirements/needs for tertiaries (not to mention individual department needs within those hospitals).

It's such a huge, fractured, web. Systems from the 90's with brand new stuff sprinkled in and adamant seniors still holding lots of power.
06/10/2020, 14:55 - Qck: Sounds like everyone should just use excel
06/10/2020, 14:56 - Dayle: Yeah vision, emis, tpp there all scuffed
06/10/2020, 14:58 - Wezz: Irony is the hosps encourage this + storing on the Trust server. I mean, it's fit for most purposes for clinical staff but the shit you see... Google docs, the worst attempts at pseudonymising data
06/10/2020, 15:01 - Qck: If someone stumbles upon my confidential bleeding anus stuff through a Google doc then it's honestly impressive that my anus has so much scope
06/10/2020, 15:02 - Qck: Never did I think it would see the day where it would end up on a document consigned by Google no less
06/10/2020, 15:02 - Qck: Be one of the prouder days me and my Anus have had over lockdown
06/10/2020, 15:04 - Dayle: Imagine someone caring about your anus enough :)
06/10/2020, 15:04 - Dayle: Lifegoals
06/10/2020, 15:04 - Qck: You've not met my dad
06/10/2020, 15:05 - Wezz: Yeah these are mostly primary care. Defo a good place to start trying to standardise data. Cause hospitals are even worse...
06/10/2020, 15:05 - Wezz: Mate, ran out of columns about your anus. Had to take that shit to MS Access
06/10/2020, 15:06 - Wezz: Too THICK for a flatfile

07/10/2020, 13:30 - Mike: It's now telling me I need to sign up to view subs
07/10/2020, 13:30 - James: I use Reddit Sync, never had any joy with other apps
07/10/2020, 13:31 - Paul: I use reddit is fun because the website started taking ages to load and giving ads
07/10/2020, 13:31 - Noone: I use the form of a new one of the year lease unfortunately I am not sure if you have any questions or concerns please visit the plug-in settings to determine how attachments are handled
07/10/2020, 14:00 - Lockers: Always used this too
07/10/2020, 14:21 - Wezz: This is the answer.
07/10/2020, 14:59 - Mike: Is that an app or something?
07/10/2020, 15:00 - Paul: Yup it's basically reddit app but just feels smoother than the official one. I tried most of them. I liked the sync one but you need to pay to remove ads. So reddit is fun was the best option imo
07/10/2020, 15:00 - Paul: Takes some getting used to but I wouldn't go back now
07/10/2020, 15:01 - Mike: I'm trying to avoid apps generally, hence annoyed they want me to create an account just to browse
07/10/2020, 15:02 - Paul: Apps make the world go round old man
07/10/2020, 15:02 - Noone: Shut the fuck up, most apps are just browsers
07/10/2020, 15:03 - Paul: Browsers make the world go round old man
07/10/2020, 16:00 - Wezz: Mate, Reddit is the least friendly browser site. They want you to download their app so bad.
07/10/2020, 16:00 - Wezz: Least Reddit is Fun is simplistic and has legacy view.
07/10/2020, 16:00 - Noone: I've gotten so used to it
07/10/2020, 16:01 - Mike: Exactly why I refuse to use it
07/10/2020, 16:02 - Mike: Upgrade the app so I prefer to use that, don't fuck your website so I have to
07/10/2020, 16:04 - Wezz: Reddit banned a load of third party apps to get theirs to launch. Reddit is Fun is one of the third party apps that remains.
07/10/2020, 16:09 - James: I just paid to remove the ads with the free Google opinion dolla
07/10/2020, 16:53 - Noone: Monkey paw consequences right there
07/10/2020, 16:58 - Piper: It keeps prompting me to download the app.. but If I do that it means I'll become hypocrite far left Paul and I don't want that to happen
07/10/2020, 16:59 - Mike: It's part of the ToS
07/10/2020, 17:10 - Mike: Just saw tfl police run into train and begin ticketing people for masks, good to see
07/10/2020, 17:11 - Mike: Small squad of them
07/10/2020, 17:12 - Paul: Down with the bourgeoisie. Rise up fellow prols
07/10/2020, 17:12 - Noone: Love to see some brains being blown out on the platform shooting squad style for mask infringements

07/10/2020, 17:30 - Mike: "In a witness statement before the court, Ms Bell, who began "detransitioning" last year, said: "I made a brash decision as a teenager, as a lot of teenagers do, trying to find confidence and happiness, except now the rest of my life will be negatively affected."

Wonder how the courts will react to that
07/10/2020, 17:35 - Noone: Yeah read this also. In a decade the most of the kids who transitioned will have killed themselves and we'll be forced to look back on this bizarre shit with contempt
07/10/2020, 17:36 - Lockers: Racist
07/10/2020, 17:39 - Wezz: Blows my mind letting children consent for elective procedures... the process should exist but the outcome should be primarily parental investigation.
07/10/2020, 17:42 - Mike: You saying my daughter can't get breast enlargement surgery? How dare you
07/10/2020, 17:45 - Wezz: You're in luck, breast enlargement surgery is the EXCEPTION... for both sexes.
07/10/2020, 17:45 - Mike: Do I get discount if I book in my son?
07/10/2020, 17:46 - Wezz: Only if I get to keep the pictures.
07/10/2020, 17:48 - Lockers: Some parents are worse, not saying I'm speaking from experience but...
07/10/2020, 17:48 - Noone: Why does Baldurs gate 3 need to be early access? Wtf is this
07/10/2020, 17:49 - Noone: Also, neck trannies, lol
07/10/2020, 17:49 - Kirky: +1
07/10/2020, 17:54 - Wezz: For sure, hard to eliminate the spectrum of bad things... this is an easy one in my opinion though. Just treat it like tattoos or cosmetic surgery.
07/10/2020, 17:55 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
07/10/2020, 17:56 - Lockers: What is it?
07/10/2020, 17:56 - Noone: Its when you take a noose to trannies and hang them until they're dead
07/10/2020, 17:57 - Wezz: I think it's when you stick their tranny cocks down your throat
07/10/2020, 17:57 - Lockers: Now I'm just confused
07/10/2020, 18:00 - Wezz: Want some surgery?
07/10/2020, 18:00 - Derren: I just had a final stage interview for an IT support role (I have 4-5 years of experience)
07/10/2020, 18:01 - Derren: The woman started asking me about my GCSE's
07/10/2020, 18:01 - Derren: and what grades I got
07/10/2020, 18:01 - Derren: like wtf I'm 29
07/10/2020, 18:01 - Derren: üòÇ
07/10/2020, 18:03 - Wezz: Bet their internal applicant has AMAZING GCSE's.

"Sorry Derren, you were pipped to the post by another applicant, they had an A in IT at GCSE! AND a B in Religious Studies! Incredible"
07/10/2020, 18:04 - Derren: Imagine, I have been working for Fox / Disney since feb 2017
07/10/2020, 18:04 - Derren: Yeah sorry Derren, you got a D in your science GCSE
07/10/2020, 18:04 - Derren: no thanks
07/10/2020, 18:05 - Derren: the thing is, the bitch was judgmental af but she was saying "like" every 2 words

07/10/2020, 20:15 - Kirky: A teachers daughter at a school in my town went to uni, came home, gave her mum (the teacher) covid, and the mum went to work and now 3 kids have it at that school already üëçüëç

07/10/2020, 20:41 - Derren: I wouldn't send my kids to school if I had them

07/10/2020, 21:17 - Mike: Maybe the scale isn't possible, every kid? Every week?
07/10/2020, 21:19 - Lockers: It's definitely not manageable
07/10/2020, 21:44 - Kirky: not possible to even temperature check?

08/10/2020, 11:08 - Dayle: Your great
08/10/2020, 11:09 - Dayle: Wait what..
08/10/2020, 11:17 - Derren: how many years late are you
08/10/2020, 11:17 - Derren: you're*
08/10/2020, 11:18 - Dayle: You're*

08/10/2020, 11:24 - Paul: I guess late? When did it come out? We don't get British t.v. here
08/10/2020, 11:25 - Noone: He just finished watching his state prescribed 17 hours a week Euro propaganda and he's ready to experience some culture again
08/10/2020, 11:26 - Noone: He's so conditioned now that if he reads the sentence "migrants aren't welcome", he begins profusely sweating and squirming in his seat
08/10/2020, 11:31 - Paul: BEM√ÑCHTIGT EUCH DER PRODUKTIONSMITTEL
08/10/2020, 11:54 - Wezz: ARBEIT MACHT FREI
08/10/2020, 11:54 - Kirky: It was on TV before you went to Germany
08/10/2020, 11:57 - James: Kayleigh and I have watched every season. Genuinely hilarious, but Derren is right, get with the program.
08/10/2020, 11:59 - Wezz: Yeah QCK recommended *No More Jockeys* on YouTube. Same crew as taskmaster. Well worth a watch of an ep and see if you like it. English comedy üëå
08/10/2020, 12:06 - Paul: Why was this never mentioned when we lived together
08/10/2020, 12:21 - James: Because you were the least respected of the throuple
08/10/2020, 12:30 - Nathan: Ohhh shhiitttt son üî•üî•üî•
08/10/2020, 13:23 - Derren: Omg James likes me
08/10/2020, 13:23 - Derren: ü•∞
08/10/2020, 13:29 - Qck: You've been in Germany for like 3 months we get it dude
08/10/2020, 13:29 - Qck: Taskmaster hit and miss because sometimes the comedians are all a bit shit
08/10/2020, 13:31 - Qck: Johnny Vegas is in the next one so it'll probably be a goodie, plus seeing Richard Herring seated next to funnier people is always great as he's an uncomfortable comedy cuckold
08/10/2020, 13:32 - James: Johnny Vegas scarred me for life. I'm very concerned I'll have a relapse watching the next season.
08/10/2020, 13:33 - Qck: Did y'all have sex in a ditch?
08/10/2020, 13:33 - Kirky: never forget
08/10/2020, 13:35 - James: He can't hurt us now Kirky
08/10/2020, 13:36 - Kirky: i didnt like him anyway and i still left with a lower opinion
08/10/2020, 13:36 - Qck: Did y'all have sex in a ditch?
08/10/2020, 13:37 - Kirky: we saw him live in reading for mikes birthday. he got progressively more drunk and kept rambling on about really depressing stuff in his life
08/10/2020, 13:38 - Kirky: sex in a ditch wouldve been prefferable
08/10/2020, 13:38 - James: He was hogging the stage, showing people his arse, and talking about how depressed he was. Considering he had given up drinking until his wife left him, it was just therapy.
08/10/2020, 13:38 - Qck: Hahaha, seems to be a fitting comedian for Mike
08/10/2020, 13:38 - James: Funniest joke of the night was from the audience, someone said he was entertaining his guinness better than the audience
08/10/2020, 13:40 - Qck: It's pretty mental to be a comic that abuses alcohol on stage as you're gonna have a really low strikerate on having a good show
08/10/2020, 13:41 - Qck: I still think the dude has a wit but that sounds like hell
08/10/2020, 13:46 - James: The night over ran by about 2 hours because he wouldn't leave the stage
08/10/2020, 13:46 - Kirky: its a shame. the other 3 were generally good and funny
08/10/2020, 14:34 - Mike: Yeh those poor lesser knowns who had to bring the crowd back between his comparing
08/10/2020, 14:35 - Mike: They did well though
08/10/2020, 17:35 - Derren: <Media omitted>
08/10/2020, 17:35 - Derren: China virus
08/10/2020, 17:35 - Kirky: war with china coming
08/10/2020, 17:35 - Kirky: called it guys, except trumps alive to lead the charge
08/10/2020, 17:35 - Lockers: Rip World
08/10/2020, 18:05 - Paul: He's been calling it that for ages at his rallies
08/10/2020, 18:05 - Derren: Chinese virus
08/10/2020, 18:05 - Paul: Yup
08/10/2020, 18:06 - Paul: And for more we go live to batsoupchinaman (Which my predictive text already knew lol)
08/10/2020, 18:13 - Noone: Thanks Paul; China is heating up this evening. Is it new years? No. Its global thermonuclear war. And it's hit China the hardest.
Here with me tonight is Mister "gook-ting-wang".
Mister gook-ting-wang, thank you for being here tonight.
_camera pans to pile of ash in leather chair_
So, Mr.Wang, how has the conflict effected every day life for you and your family?
....
I see. And are you concerned at all over the uncertain economic future, now that trainers and iPhone production has been shipped to Vietnam?
....
An interesting take for sure. That's all we have time for this evening, back to you in the studio, cuck.
_camera pulls away as the lights in the studio fade, audio becomes softer and I begin rearranging papers on my desk and I audibly laughing at Mr Gook's witticisms
08/10/2020, 18:14 - Noone: Inaudibly*
08/10/2020, 18:31 - Paul: And now to lockers with the sport
08/10/2020, 21:03 - Mike: For an average video game, what % of players do you think ever "complete" it? Assuming it has some end goal
08/10/2020, 21:11 - Lockers: Not sure I've ever completed a game. Need a form of competition
08/10/2020, 21:13 - Kirky: sub 20%
08/10/2020, 21:14 - Kirky: there are some steam stats you can see on games. a lot of super popular gmes like darksouls, its like sub 10% actually beat the first boss or someshit.
08/10/2020, 21:18 - Kirky: <Media omitted>

20/10/2020, 19:29 - Kirky: you guys remember the school i mentioned where the teacher came in with covid?
20/10/2020, 19:29 - Kirky: its on lockdown now. no kids are allowed in at all. bunch are self isolating. 4 or 5 teachers self isolating
20/10/2020, 19:30 - Paul: Don't remember what I ate for breakfast
20/10/2020, 19:35 - Wezz: I never eat breakfast... so I don't have to face my crippling dementia
20/10/2020, 19:35 - Paul: I don't either but technically my lunch is my breakfast

20/10/2020, 20:12 - Wezz: oh fuck right off
20/10/2020, 20:12 - Paul: Those look like worksite noise reduction things so a different environment... I hope
20/10/2020, 22:48 - Mike: https://www.merriam-webster.com/time-traveler/1991
20/10/2020, 22:49 - Mike: Cybersex was first printed the year I was born, suck it virgins
20/10/2020, 23:14 - Noone: There's one crouched inside your butthole right now
20/10/2020, 23:16 - Lockers: Any excuse to get your finger up there right???
20/10/2020, 23:27 - Derren: The year I was born too ü•≥
20/10/2020, 23:28 - Noone: Imagine remembering the 90s, fucking hell
20/10/2020, 23:32 - Derren: Imagine owning a female car
20/10/2020, 23:32 - Noone: SHUTUP
20/10/2020, 23:32 - Derren: ü•∫
20/10/2020, 23:32 - Derren: https://youtu.be/btYYvOd18qU
20/10/2020, 23:33 - Derren: Been getting recommended vids like this recently
20/10/2020, 23:39 - Noone: Pepper Ann, bear and the big blue house, Steve Erwin all good things I'll give you thay
20/10/2020, 23:39 - Noone: Rest of it can go in the BIN
20/10/2020, 23:39 - Noone: Oh wait, good Will hunting and contact can stay also
21/10/2020, 07:45 - Lockers: Cars have genders?
21/10/2020, 07:50 - James: My car is a female, it would be pretty gay to regularly be in a guy
21/10/2020, 09:09 - Derren: @447757709019 https://amp.theguardian.com/business/2020/oct/21/postal-workers-to-collect-from-the-doorstep-as-royal-mail-shakes-up-service
21/10/2020, 09:09 - Derren: üëÄ
21/10/2020, 09:11 - Kirky: Yes I know. Literally no body is happy about it. Most anti worker thing theyve done since I started
21/10/2020, 09:11 - Kirky: Some cunt in an office thats never been on delivery probably got a massive bonus for coming up with it aswell
21/10/2020, 09:15 - James: Can I pay 79p for you to come collect me and my PC Kirky? Like, gather everyone up for a LAN on the cheap.
21/10/2020, 09:16 - Mike: What's the issues from workers point of view? Slowing down the routes massively I guess but in terms of efficiency it's gonna be a big plus
21/10/2020, 09:18 - Paul: Are you in the CWU Kirky?
21/10/2020, 09:26 - Kirky: Slowing down mainly. Already pushed with Christmas levels of delivery all year and Christmas itself is coming up. Royal mail in general is still short staffed for delivery cause they dont wanna hire anyone during covid.
21/10/2020, 09:27 - Kirky: So we've got full deliverys no clearing as it is, some deliverys arent getting cleared due to time restraints even when someone is assigned to it, and now we have to deal with this aswell
21/10/2020, 09:27 - Kirky: And yes I am Paul
21/10/2020, 09:27 - Kirky: Oh and we are getting nothing out of it at all except more work load
21/10/2020, 09:29 - Kirky: It's also killing post offices. Spoken to a few people running smaller POs and they're worried its gonna cut a lot of their income from people just getting shit picked up
21/10/2020, 09:31 - Mike: Yeh that makes sense, maybe covid will have killed enough by Christmas you won't have as much to deliver?
21/10/2020, 09:32 - James: Don't need to deliver any presents if Santa gets COVID
21/10/2020, 09:32 - James: <Media omitted>
21/10/2020, 09:34 - Paul: Yay?
21/10/2020, 09:42 - Kirky: Also abit of a slap in the face. Shittest year ever, Christmas levels of delivery for 6 months. Now they want to add more work and no gain for us. They say it's to help RM but we're losing 1 million a DAY apparently, but also Christmas is our most profitable time of the year
21/10/2020, 09:42 - Kirky: If they're still.losing 1 mil a day with Christmas levels for 6 months rm deserves to die
21/10/2020, 09:43 - Kirky: Or some executives should be fired
21/10/2020, 09:43 - James: I choose the second option
21/10/2020, 09:43 - James: Fire everyone above Kirky
21/10/2020, 09:44 - James: Make him new CEO
21/10/2020, 09:44 - Noone: Not gunna be good on your back, having to bend down and pick shit off the floor
21/10/2020, 09:44 - Noone: Kirky executive officer
21/10/2020, 09:44 - Kirky: Honestly its be nice to have a CEO that's done the job üòÇüòÇ
21/10/2020, 09:45 - Mike: Wasn't it positing profits just before it was privatised?
21/10/2020, 09:45 - Kirky: Our CEO went out on a delivery. Said "wow how do you do this every day?" Then a week later added more work load üëåüëåüëåüëå
21/10/2020, 09:45 - Kirky: Probably why government sold it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I'm not sure that was before my time
21/10/2020, 09:46 - Kirky: We dont even get low level managers that have been on delivery anymore. Noone above us understands this job üòÇ
21/10/2020, 11:11 - Mike: Pretty certain it was, hence the outrage because of conservatives selling a public service that actually brought in money..
21/10/2020, 11:11 - Mike: "wow, thank god I'll never have to do that again"
21/10/2020, 11:12 - Paul: Public services aren't even meant to bring in money and they sold it even with that bonus lol
21/10/2020, 11:29 - Paul: Football people, question for you. Has the home/away advantage noticeably changed since playing without crowds?
21/10/2020, 11:31 - Paul: https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/16/how-the-home-team-advantage-is-lost-when-no-ones-watching
21/10/2020, 11:32 - Paul: Looks like it has made a difference. Interesting, away teams get less yellow cards without crowd pressure. I was thinking more about teams performance, didn't even consider the refs
21/10/2020, 11:44 - Mike: Official reasoning was that Royal Mail needed cash investment or it would die soon due to challenges from the private sector ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
21/10/2020, 11:46 - Kirky: Still gonna die soon due to challenges from the private sector üòÇüòÇ
21/10/2020, 11:47 - Kirky: Cant keep up with other delivery company's. No delivery Sunday, no late deliverys, early cut offs for next day delivery, high next day delivery costs on top of that
21/10/2020, 14:16 - Dayle: <Media omitted>
21/10/2020, 15:00 - Wezz: Next level unionisation protecting employees. E.g. no GPS trackers.

They will kill it. And then bring it back as a technology driven Uber-esk company. Everyone has a phone, can literally use it to tell people where to deliver things. Employees don't even need to speak English tbh.
21/10/2020, 15:00 - Wezz: That'll last until the drones take over
21/10/2020, 15:00 - Wezz: By that point the world will've nuked itself into oblivion
21/10/2020, 15:00 - Wezz: Happy 2025
21/10/2020, 15:01 - Paul: It's not the unions fault other companies don't care about their employees
21/10/2020, 15:01 - Wezz: Available for hire btw, I'm fun at parties...promise.
21/10/2020, 15:03 - Wezz: Sure thing I agree. But to be competitive you need to offer these things to customers, or be cheaper. Otherwise you gonna get forced out the market.
21/10/2020, 15:03 - Paul: Unless we all unionised!
21/10/2020, 15:03 - Wezz: Ala black cabs
21/10/2020, 15:04 - Wezz: Sure thing, I'm in if everyone else is in üëÄ
21/10/2020, 15:07 - Wezz: Don't stop at unions, let's have regulatory bodies. Got a chance to make some meaningful regional change. But you also hurt GDP üôÅ
21/10/2020, 15:08 - Paul: Why does it hurt GDP? Less unemployment, increased market fluidity, right?
21/10/2020, 15:11 - Wezz: Well, my pea brain says employee rights and unions slow down the capitalist machine. Which in turn creates inefficiencies meaning less product for ¬£.
21/10/2020, 15:12 - Wezz: E.g. Slaves are 10/10. Don't complain or demand. Karen in IT wants a foot stall and two pillows 2/10.
21/10/2020, 15:13 - Paul: True until everyone unionises. Yeah, so it's a vicious cycle. If kirkys competitors were also unionised he wouldn't need to work extra hours to compete. The only way they'd compete is by growing their productivity in other ways, so better equipment and more employees
21/10/2020, 15:16 - Wezz: Yeah it's the G20 all over again. Everyone has to be in otherwise it's a huge detriment.

And considering the direction the economy is going. The big wigs will look to lower costs. If they can't, they close and open as RoyalFedEX employing the desperate at a low-cost using tech to support and GPS to maximise efficiency, and hold employees accountable.
21/10/2020, 15:17 - Qck: Aren't all postal workers under the CWU flag
21/10/2020, 15:18 - Wezz: So my first statement should be 'sacrifice'. G20 isn't a detriment at any level. But a country doesn't sign up, they benefit enormously with cheap fuel
21/10/2020, 15:19 - Paul: I dunno if this happens automatically, especially for other postal works other than royal mail. You'd need to ask kirky
21/10/2020, 15:19 - Paul: Yeah agreed
21/10/2020, 15:20 - Qck: Just sounds like RM have to turn into FedEx because who sends letters anymore
21/10/2020, 15:21 - Paul: E.g. I don't think Amazon guys can unionise
21/10/2020, 15:21 - Paul: I'm pretty sure it's just my girlfriend and her mates sending postcards to each other keeping it in business
21/10/2020, 15:21 - Wezz: How's this even enforced? Seems crazy.
21/10/2020, 15:22 - Qck: Because Amazon use delivery companies and aren't a delivery company themselves
21/10/2020, 15:23 - Qck: So the onus is on these backwater companies hiring illegals to hop on the GMB union
21/10/2020, 15:23 - Paul: It looks like it's an on going issue just from looking around quickly
21/10/2020, 15:24 - Qck: Amazon and ongoing issues
21/10/2020, 15:24 - Qck: Name a more iconic dio
21/10/2020, 15:24 - Wezz: They should take a mini shit and RTS every company letter sent from now on.
21/10/2020, 15:24 - Paul: But that sweet next day delivery ü§§
21/10/2020, 15:24 - Qck: Dio ü§ò
21/10/2020, 15:24 - Wezz: That's pretty smart.
21/10/2020, 15:25 - Wezz: Also they're crushing the delivery game. Clearly just need slave labour and we can all live in protected ivory towers
21/10/2020, 15:26 - Qck: Bruh my nail scissors and protein shaker have been delayed two days in a row now so I'm inclined to disagree
21/10/2020, 15:26 - Mike: Can't sue Uber if one of their employees rapes you after he failed his background check, Uber has no employees and is actually just run by a single car behind a desk in Canary Wharf
21/10/2020, 15:26 - Paul: Assuming you won't be one of the slaves
21/10/2020, 15:27 - Wezz: You live in a banana's asshole though
21/10/2020, 15:27 - Wezz: My shit never gets delayed. Can track him down on GPS and rape him
21/10/2020, 15:27 - Qck: Mr. Prius the CEO of Uber
21/10/2020, 15:29 - Wezz: If needs must. I'll be there, nabbing the odd free protein shaker and clippers.
21/10/2020, 15:29 - Qck: I think I live in the only part of London that doesn't do same-day so yeah basically a banana's anus
21/10/2020, 15:31 - Wezz: I can order shit at 5pm and get it by 8pm.

Once ordered a novelty doorstop and the man must have ran from the warehouse to my door. Got it in like 2 hours
21/10/2020, 15:32 - Kirky: Yea they're pushing parcels hard. As of 2 years ago letters are down 50% over 10 year period and I assume the decrease is accelerating hard
21/10/2020, 15:34 - Kirky: Do you know how much work thatd be for me üò≠ü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æ
21/10/2020, 15:34 - Kirky: Takes longer to RTS stuff than deliver it
21/10/2020, 15:36 - Kirky: Delivered around 100 letters to just one company today. Each letter would need a sticker, which needs 3 ticks, my initials and date, then address crossed out and rts addresses circled. I hate doing it üòÇüòÇ
21/10/2020, 15:43 - Noone: Is Karen black?
21/10/2020, 15:45 - Wezz: Yes. Oddly enough the slaves are white ü§î
21/10/2020, 15:45 - Wezz: This message was deleted
21/10/2020, 15:46 - Wezz: I think if you shit in the letter the rest of this process is IMPLIED.
21/10/2020, 16:13 - Kirky: <Media omitted>
21/10/2020, 16:47 - James: Fun fact, Paul said cows eat birds
21/10/2020, 16:47 - James: Literally the last thing he said to me
21/10/2020, 16:47 - James: <Media omitted>
21/10/2020, 16:47 - Noone: What a retard
21/10/2020, 16:48 - Noone: Big fan, did you say hello to them?
21/10/2020, 16:48 - James: You like cows Jack?
21/10/2020, 16:48 - Noone: Big fan
21/10/2020, 16:49 - James: I saw a cow once
21/10/2020, 16:50 - James: <Media omitted>
21/10/2020, 16:50 - Kirky: Of course and I called them beautiful
21/10/2020, 16:50 - Kirky: How old are you there ?
21/10/2020, 16:57 - James: About 16?
21/10/2020, 16:58 - Noone: Hello :>
21/10/2020, 17:08 - Wezz: Nooooooo - James
21/10/2020, 17:08 - Wezz: Definitely said mooooooo*
21/10/2020, 17:08 - James: NOOOOOOO!
21/10/2020, 17:13 - Wezz: Thanks James
21/10/2020, 17:18 - Qck: Is that a cow/dog hybrid or are you 8ft tall in this photo?
21/10/2020, 17:19 - James: Both
21/10/2020, 18:34 - Paul: You look great. Kid on the right is a bit of a goober though
21/10/2020, 18:34 - Qck: Ah the ol' reddit kill yourself Paul
21/10/2020, 18:35 - Paul: Uh oh jumping down this rabbit hole! Wish me luck reddit
21/10/2020, 18:36 - Paul: Is your WhatsApp in some darkmode I don't know about
21/10/2020, 18:37 - James: Desktop whatsapp

21/10/2020, 18:38 - Lockers: <Media omitted>
21/10/2020, 18:39 - Qck: Yeah mine's in dark mode but I'm certain that the background images are all subliminal messaging
21/10/2020, 18:40 - Qck: For some reason I have the urge to Google "Priscilla Chan feet"

21/10/2020, 18:41 - Qck: Did this just get uploaded to dumpert?
21/10/2020, 18:42 - Derren: üëÄ
21/10/2020, 19:05 - Wezz: made me lol
21/10/2020, 19:07 - Wezz: had to google who she was. why am i not surprised he has an Asian bride
21/10/2020, 19:50 - Dayle: Dont you love it when your pen test company comes back after 3 weeks of testing and finds nothing. yeah i do too :) time for a DRINK
21/10/2020, 19:50 - Wezz: I'll 'ave a go
21/10/2020, 19:51 - Wezz: white hats be noobing
21/10/2020, 20:01 - Lockers: GONZO HEART ATTACK everywhere
21/10/2020, 20:17 - Dayle: Imagine, Hi guys sam here is not a techie but BAM ]
21/10/2020, 20:17 - Dayle: not scared we just dont have any external endpoints for you to try :(
21/10/2020, 20:18 - Kirky: Gonzo heart attack my favourite thing
21/10/2020, 20:24 - Wezz: security through obscurity ay. fair enough
21/10/2020, 20:28 - Mike: Sounds like shit pen testers, hire another company to try as well to be sure
21/10/2020, 20:28 - Mike: When that company comes up with same results, hire a third
21/10/2020, 20:29 - Mike: Get fired for spending all your companies cash on 15 penetration testing companies
21/10/2020, 20:35 - Wezz: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOVyZw_r9jE&feature=youtu.be
21/10/2020, 20:36 - Wezz: (nsfw)
21/10/2020, 21:08 - Qck: Ryan has such great shorts
21/10/2020, 21:09 - Qck: This, Bass Pro Shop, Casino Review etc
21/10/2020, 21:09 - Wezz: yeah bass pro shop is how i found him ol
21/10/2020, 21:11 - Qck: He's been the editor for Funhaus for a while now, he's a funny dude
21/10/2020, 21:21 - Paul: Laughed a lot imaging what his neighbours thought hearing him shout this shit
21/10/2020, 21:23 - Wezz: Just made me laugh him faking his disappointment with the whole thing, despite obviously spending hours drawing it. Stupid video tbh, have to be in a certain mood for sure
21/10/2020, 21:23 - Wezz: not seen but on the LIST now
21/10/2020, 21:39 - Qck: They're really good, their demo disk gameplay, board game show, building ikea furniture without the instructions, drunk gameplay etc all gems
21/10/2020, 21:41 - Mike: I have that exact game, it's actually super satisfying even if you cant draw for shit
21/10/2020, 21:43 - James: Yeah, tilt brush is fun man
21/10/2020, 22:42 - Kirky: Bit drunk so read the whole thing. No its opt in and costs me 2.20 a week üëç but that gets me basically invincibility against being fired along ad I stick to my job description and they cover court costs for anything (along as its within or cam be argued to be within the description)
21/10/2020, 22:47 - Kirky: Cant guarantee me my job back in unfair dismissal but will sue RM on my behalf
21/10/2020, 22:49 - Qck: Makes sense, thanks for saving me from making a faux pas at a party as CWU talk is normally my go to
21/10/2020, 22:51 - Wezz: Smart lady right here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LHXSgmmhuk
21/10/2020, 22:55 - Wezz: I thought your goto was vulnerable children?
21/10/2020, 23:07 - Kirky: Ah youd fit right in with us at the Christmas doos
21/10/2020, 23:08 - Kirky: We get really drunk all link arms and start singing songs about the great CWU and pay tributes to its former leaders
21/10/2020, 23:13 - Qck: I do remember sexually assaulting Jack the last time we were at Mike's so definitely some truth there
21/10/2020, 23:15 - Qck: "Oh glorious CWU, our post is good and so are you..."
21/10/2020, 23:29 - Mike: Can confirm, later in the night he convulsed like a zombie possessed on my floor. Wezz said nothing and held me tight.
21/10/2020, 23:30 - Wezz: I'm always here for you xox
22/10/2020, 00:12 - Noone: Isn't he kill along with Adam kovic? There was that big scandal at rooster teeth
22/10/2020, 00:36 - Qck: Oh I knew nothing about this and am reading up on it now, seems like Adam is kill for sure
22/10/2020, 00:38 - Qck: Bruh when I left yours I did a big sick outside your tube station, caught the train, lay down on a set of disabled seats and continued convulsing
22/10/2020, 00:45 - Qck: Now I'm just trying to find out what both their naked bodies look like
22/10/2020, 01:08 - Qck: Kovic must use Veet to get an asshole that pristine
22/10/2020, 01:22 - Qck: Also it's Ryan Haywood (Rooster Teeth) who is the sack of shit not the homeless Ryan who works at FH and made the tilt brush vid
22/10/2020, 08:17 - Derren: Typical black woman oppressed by her white colleagues and forced to give a speech to condem blm because she's black and these racist white üê∑üêΩ can't do it out of fear üëÄ
22/10/2020, 08:18 - Paul: James Randi died. Rip a legend
22/10/2020, 08:31 - Wezz: No way. He's my password to loads of accounts....
22/10/2020, 08:31 - Wezz: Good innings all things considered. Absolute legend. One of a few idols.
22/10/2020, 08:41 - Wezz: Oh the web we weave..
22/10/2020, 08:42 - Derren: https://youtu.be/bEJ1jc1tPLg
22/10/2020, 08:58 - Wezz: Almost spat my water out when she said "house nigger"

Good on her, but she's also living the political group identity life. One and the same imo, despite her side being less common these days.

22/10/2020, 09:04 - Derren: Why

22/10/2020, 09:18 - Paul: But lol
22/10/2020, 09:19 - Paul: Speaking of books. I'm getting near the end of my list. Can everyone post their favourite book or a book They'd recommend?
22/10/2020, 09:19 - Paul: And no Jack not mein kampf
22/10/2020, 09:35 - James: I'm reading Mythos at the moment, really great if you're interested in Greek myth and etymology
22/10/2020, 09:45 - Kirky: Readings for nerds. All I read are mistos get up rolls
22/10/2020, 10:13 - Derren: bitch plz I don't roll, get up attack everytime
22/10/2020, 10:14 - Wezz: Rek'd
22/10/2020, 10:15 - Wezz: I like to read this gaming team's WhatsApp group. You've probably never heard of it.
22/10/2020, 10:21 - Paul: 5 replies and 1 book
22/10/2020, 10:39 - Wezz: I enjoyed the Glass Bead Game
22/10/2020, 10:39 - Wezz: German author too.
22/10/2020, 10:43 - Paul: Is it a fiction or what?
22/10/2020, 10:44 - Paul: Looks interesting
22/10/2020, 10:45 - Paul: Has anyone read crime and punishment? I've heard good things but also that all the Russian names get confusing
22/10/2020, 10:53 - James: It's a chronology of Greek mythology as told my Stephen Fry
22/10/2020, 10:54 - James: by*
22/10/2020, 13:05 - Mike: A conservative advocating government get involved in political affiliation protection? Naw dawg
22/10/2020, 14:21 - Wezz: A Dostoevsky classic.... Yeah never read it
22/10/2020, 14:22 - Wezz: There's 6 parts to the synopsis on its wiki too so TLDR
22/10/2020, 14:22 - James: Big fan of Gnome Chomsky
22/10/2020, 14:22 - James: He was my favourite left 4 dead 2 character

22/10/2020, 14:23 - Noone: Reported
22/10/2020, 14:23 - Noone: Stfu
22/10/2020, 14:23 - James: Jesus dude
22/10/2020, 14:24 - Qck: Honestly the biggest issue with Dostoevsky is that he named his characters with Russian names instead of just calling his protagonist Fred
22/10/2020, 14:25 - Qck: Amount of times I had to pause during brothers karamazov because I had no clue who was talking to who and why
22/10/2020, 14:25 - Wezz: I've heard insatiable lepidoptera's are good protagonists
22/10/2020, 14:27 - Qck: Can't corner the dorner
22/10/2020, 14:27 - Derren: Wat
22/10/2020, 14:29 - Mike: Ctrl+r on the paper bro
22/10/2020, 14:39 - Wezz: You thinking ctrl+h for find and replace?
22/10/2020, 14:47 - Mike: Who uses Ctrl+h? Word? I read my books in my developer console
22/10/2020, 15:30 - James: Most things use control+h, notepad++, regular notepad
22/10/2020, 15:30 - Wezz: Anyone who worked (even a single day) from home due to COVID should complete this:

22/10/2020, 15:31 - Wezz: You get a ¬£240 (whole year) even if you just had a single day at home. Pretty nuts but worth doing.
22/10/2020, 15:31 - Wezz: "tax break btw
22/10/2020, 15:32 - Wezz: Full guide for those who are into the nitty gritty (https://blog.moneysavingexpert.com/2020/04/martin-lewis--working-from-home-due-to-coronavirus--claim-p6-wk-/#microservice)
22/10/2020, 15:35 - Wezz: Okay I said ¬£240, but it's actually half that. My bad.
22/10/2020, 15:36 - Mike: "You cannot claim tax relief if you choose to work from home."
22/10/2020, 15:36 - Mike: FML
22/10/2020, 15:37 - Wezz: Pfft, I'm sure there was a single day where they couldn't have you at the office for x reason
22/10/2020, 15:37 - Wezz: That's the day you claim for and then pow, whole year.
22/10/2020, 15:37 - Wezz: Peak of covid things were fucked, your place never closed?
22/10/2020, 15:45 - Mike: They reduced numbers but still always offered space for people to come in, basically no one wanted to though so they never overflowed
22/10/2020, 15:56 - Wezz: We were rota'd in on certain days. So that counts apparently #winning

22/10/2020, 18:06 - Paul: In your ass
22/10/2020, 22:11 - Derren: @447943624891 you have a 3600x cpu?

22/10/2020, 22:11 - Derren: Make sure you install this latest chipset driver
22/10/2020, 22:13 - Mike: 3800x I think
22/10/2020, 22:26 - Derren: Get the chipset driver

22/10/2020, 23:19 - Paul: No siglemic 12.6 slide run?
23/10/2020, 08:59 - Wezz: Miss the glory days ü•∫ watching sig fail cannonless for the upteenth time
23/10/2020, 09:02 - Wezz: I swear the whole scene turned gender fluid and stopped caring about speedrunning lol. Guess that's what running the same retro game to the ms does to someone.
23/10/2020, 09:05 - Mike: Alex Jones was so close, they're putting chemicals in the video games and turning the speed runners gay
23/10/2020, 09:11 - Paul: If this whole escapade doesn't demonstrate the group influence then I dunno what will
23/10/2020, 10:31 - Derren: <Media omitted>
23/10/2020, 10:33 - Noone: Speed running has always existed in the weird space of videogames. They're like outcasts of outcasts. Makes sense they'd reinvent themselves to try and fit into a group?
23/10/2020, 10:42 - Derren: <Media omitted>
23/10/2020, 10:44 - Derren: They still care about speed running, even popular streamers have started speed running mario 64

23/10/2020, 11:12 - Wezz: Fo sure. Think there's also an interesting dynamic where pariahs unexpectedly receive social standing through streaming obscure achievements.

Then someone in their peripheral comes out as gender X and receives sympathy/attention/support. Cue next attempt at fitting in.

23/10/2020, 18:36 - Paul: Am I gullible as hell? I thought it was some super clever AI
23/10/2020, 18:49 - James: I'm pretty sure it is AI, but it probably uses a library of tagged photo elements that is swaps and blend with an identified face

24/10/2020, 12:55 - Derren: That I'll get 250k back
24/10/2020, 12:57 - Paul: 50/1 is insane odds
24/10/2020, 12:57 - Paul: Worth a fiver for sure
24/10/2020, 12:57 - Derren: Is what I said correct then?
24/10/2020, 12:57 - Derren: I might put 500 on it
24/10/2020, 12:57 - Derren: üòÇ
24/10/2020, 12:58 - Paul: I mean it's pretty unlikely considering all the polls (Which are usually pretty accurate) but 50/1 is nuts.
24/10/2020, 12:59 - Paul: But yeah I think what you said is correct
24/10/2020, 13:00 - Paul: Googling the odds I'm seeing nothing even close to those odds. Are you sure it's real
24/10/2020, 13:01 - Derren: Go to the William Hill site
24/10/2020, 13:01 - Derren: And try the code I guess

25/10/2020, 21:48 - Kirky: Ya is only dark chocolate in them
25/10/2020, 22:46 - Mike: That Borat Rudy guilani scene, fucking hell
25/10/2020, 23:32 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
25/10/2020, 23:37 - Mike: The movie itself was ok, don't not really memorable
26/10/2020, 01:41 - Wezz: Just watched it. Some funny bits, more staged than his usual stuff and quite a bit of filler. That Guilani scene was so dodgy.
27/10/2020, 11:44 - Paul: Haven't watched it yet but I heard basically none of it was staged and they went to pretty long lengths
27/10/2020, 11:54 - Wezz: I mean, definitely a lot of it was staged. When you watch it you'll see. Already have been some people come forward saying they were paid. However the reactions seem real (e.g. people don't know what's happening). Waivers obv signed too.
27/10/2020, 11:56 - Wezz: Doesn't make it any worse necessarily. Same as SBCs other stuff. Some really good and clever scenes. Whole thing is pretty political
27/10/2020, 12:35 - Mike: I think the more one on one /smaller group stuff seemed very staged, the crashing contentions and shit seemed legit
27/10/2020, 12:35 - James: That's a contentious claim
27/10/2020, 12:35 - Wezz: Completely depends on your definition of legit. It happened yes.
27/10/2020, 12:35 - Mike: Guilani definitely thought he was about fuck a random accented reporter
27/10/2020, 12:36 - Paul: I'll reserve judgement. I remember thinking loads of the first one was fake. Looked in to it and was surprised how of it was genuinely real but obviously edited to be more funny
27/10/2020, 12:36 - Paul: How much*
27/10/2020, 12:37 - Wezz: Tonnes of BTS clips up you can see. And SBC interviews, he's clearly marketing his movie through the uncertainty/hype, and exaggerates everything.
27/10/2020, 12:38 - Wezz: Also scene breakdowns on YouTube to highlight edits for you:
https://youtu.be/3TCs3o323Bk
27/10/2020, 12:38 - Mike: Even got trump on the gang
27/10/2020, 12:39 - Wezz: But is a fun movie, worth watching.
27/10/2020, 12:39 - Paul: I see it kinda like derren brown
27/10/2020, 12:40 - Wezz: Far more political than anything derrens done
27/10/2020, 12:40 - Paul: No I mean as a concept. Whether it's fake or not is part of the intrigue
27/10/2020, 12:41 - Paul: "No way he actually did that or said that" is part of the fun afterwards
27/10/2020, 12:45 - Wezz: Yeah same unknowns for sure. Less scrutiny as it's a movie/edit.

I would just watch it tbh, Rudy scene is dirty. Baby scene made me laugh out loud, plus song, and some standard heart warming bits too. 90 mins worth it
27/10/2020, 12:46 - Paul: It says we get both versions but I can't get it to change to English on my Xbox app üòï
27/10/2020, 12:46 - Paul: Although the German borat voice is actually not bad lol
27/10/2020, 12:53 - Mike: I gave it a 6.5, kinda same as Borat to me
27/10/2020, 12:56 - Wezz: Yeah I'm about a 7. Loads of filler but good scenes make up for it.
27/10/2020, 14:06 - Qck: Ich heibe Borat
27/10/2020, 14:08 - Paul: Ich auch, danke

27/10/2020, 21:41 - James: Do you not think being a Manley is bad enough
27/10/2020, 21:41 - James: Manlet*
27/10/2020, 22:05 - Piper: That's Paul Mike and ed
27/10/2020, 22:06 - Piper: Death of the pope

27/10/2020, 22:14 - Piper: Thats where I'm heading
27/10/2020, 22:16 - Piper: If you were implying I was the middle one
27/10/2020, 22:28 - Lockers: All in the coffin?
27/10/2020, 22:39 - Piper: We all dead
27/10/2020, 22:40 - Lockers: Inside

28/10/2020, 10:39 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
28/10/2020, 10:53 - Derren: ü•∫
28/10/2020, 11:06 - Noone: Fuck off with this shit
28/10/2020, 11:11 - Lockers: Did that offend you m8
28/10/2020, 11:31 - Wezz: Sorry I'll make sure it's >Greentext next time
28/10/2020, 11:58 - Paul: >be me

28/10/2020, 12:00 - Wezz: 10x better if i'm honest
28/10/2020, 12:40 - Nathan: Ginger cunt*
28/10/2020, 12:41 - Nathan: Sorry Paul, just a cheap laugh
28/10/2020, 12:42 - Paul: No no that's fair
28/10/2020, 12:57 - Mike: <Media omitted>
28/10/2020, 13:22 - Noone: It's a special moment I don't want ruined
28/10/2020, 13:23 - Noone: Typical northerner, always going for the cheap option
28/10/2020, 13:23 - Noone: The commie one needs to be much skinnier, and the freedom one much more muscled and cool with sunglasses
28/10/2020, 13:31 - Paul: And a few swastika tattoos
28/10/2020, 13:32 - Paul: Commie one also needs a half optimistic half dejected expression. Can you pass on our notes Mike?
28/10/2020, 13:35 - Noone: Yeah I suppose that's fair, considering the comparative to a communist isn't a "freedom" unicorn but actually a murderer. Not as murderous as the commie unicorn ofc, nothing has proven to be more deadly in history as an ideology than commie unicorns but Nazi-corn is a good compromise
28/10/2020, 13:37 - Lockers: <Media omitted>
28/10/2020, 13:37 - Paul: Yes I agree! A faux-communist hammer and sickle Soviet government has a lot of blood on its hands!
28/10/2020, 13:38 - Noone: There's one of these in Canterbury and its existence is a moral good
28/10/2020, 13:38 - Paul: Same franchise I worked in the ramsgate store
28/10/2020, 13:38 - Noone: Someone restrain this lunatic

28/10/2020, 13:38 - Paul: Before I went to cccu
28/10/2020, 13:39 - Noone: I used to go in there for milk duds like every day after sixth form
28/10/2020, 13:39 - Noone: 2012-2014?
28/10/2020, 13:39 - Paul: Yeah but I worked mostly in the summer holidays
28/10/2020, 13:40 - Noone: Oh I see. I wonder if I ever saw you working there when I was at Chatham House and thought "get a load of this ginger commie faggot"
28/10/2020, 13:41 - Paul: I remember seeing a few teachers but rarely students I don't think it was during term time
28/10/2020, 13:43 - Paul: Was a really nice job. I would often say that you rarely had any customer issues as no one goes in a sweet shop in a bad mood
28/10/2020, 13:43 - Lockers: Thought I recognised it, didn't realise it was national
28/10/2020, 13:48 - Kirky: <Media omitted>
28/10/2020, 13:49 - Noone: All the better to put that thing sideways and driftu the Cotswalds
28/10/2020, 13:50 - Paul: CHECK EMISSIONS
28/10/2020, 13:55 - Wezz: So true, a mini Disneyland.
28/10/2020, 13:55 - Wezz: Post is cancelled - fuck that
28/10/2020, 14:36 - Nathan: One in the Trafford Centre! Even us northern folk can revel in ye olde sweet shop!
28/10/2020, 14:36 - Lockers: Nothing counts north of Watford
28/10/2020, 14:37 - Lockers: Put em all in lockdown I say
28/10/2020, 14:42 - Wezz: LOCK EM UP LOCK EM  UP

30/10/2020, 09:40 - Kirky: Oxford city tier 2 as of Saturday üëå
30/10/2020, 09:40 - Noone: Ruh roh
30/10/2020, 09:41 - Lockers: Just to check, I'm in a tier 1 area, but I still shouldn't meet
A) with people from tier 2 outside of the tier 2 area
B) within the area either
30/10/2020, 09:42 - Lockers: Right?
30/10/2020, 09:45 - Dayle: <Media omitted>
30/10/2020, 10:14 - Wezz: Yeah I think all tiers aren't supposed to travel (that's the idea) it's a cluster fuck though.
30/10/2020, 10:15 - Wezz: Like I have people quoting the bubble guidance still.. no idea if that's in place.
30/10/2020, 10:15 - Lockers: Right. Work in a tier 2, don't socialise in it
30/10/2020, 10:15 - Lockers: Pretty sure it is
30/10/2020, 10:19 - Noone: Rules are: don't socialise unless you're kirky && you bring brownies
30/10/2020, 10:30 - Paul: I can see it now. 50 years from now the tier wars are still on going. No one can remember why the UK is broken into tiers but that doesn't matter because fuck tier 2
30/10/2020, 10:30 - James: Hahahaha
30/10/2020, 10:30 - James: This is the first step towards the districts in hunger games
30/10/2020, 10:31 - Lockers: I volunteer as tribute!
30/10/2020, 10:31 - James: The tier system keeps growing until every city has its own tier, and everything in between was covered in napalm to kill the virus
30/10/2020, 12:00 - Nathan: Wow, I see the light now!
30/10/2020, 15:21 - Paul: <Media omitted>
30/10/2020, 15:22 - Kirky: That's atleast double
30/10/2020, 15:25 - Mike: Lol Nvidia suckers
30/10/2020, 15:27 - Wezz: woah, but *green = good* and *red = bad*?
30/10/2020, 15:28 - Mike: No it's a cultural thing, this graph was made in china where red = good
30/10/2020, 15:29 - Wezz: _Red represents fire and is the most popular color in China. It is also the national color representing happiness, beauty, vitality, good luck, success and good fortune._
Holy shit Mike's right ü§Ø
30/10/2020, 15:29 - Paul: It's also the best political colour, right Jack?
30/10/2020, 15:30 - Mike: But is green bad though? I would have thought black bed cos racists
30/10/2020, 15:30 - Paul: classic Mike, so green with Envy of the chinese
30/10/2020, 15:33 - Kirky: But red is also faster than green
30/10/2020, 15:34 - Wezz: Black GOOD - have you not seen the latest marketing campaigns?
30/10/2020, 15:36 - Wezz: If they added stripes to the green?
30/10/2020, 16:29 - Kirky: Depends on the colour and styling
30/10/2020, 16:29 - Kirky: Pink and 2 straight down the middle? Cant get any faster tbh

31/10/2020, 08:57 - Kirky: I want pics of your costumes too
31/10/2020, 09:20 - Paul: So world's biggest coincidence: the school Julia works at is partnered with the Kent school of English in broadstairs and make a yearly trip there with the students. What are the odds of that shit?
31/10/2020, 09:48 - Lockers: Everything goes back to Kent somehow
31/10/2020, 10:15 - Kirky: <Media omitted>
31/10/2020, 10:15 - Lockers: Racist
31/10/2020, 10:16 - Mike: Me and wezz said exactly this
31/10/2020, 10:16 - Noone: Killer Mike on the mic
31/10/2020, 10:16 - Mike: That rain is rocking
31/10/2020, 10:17 - Wezz: Ow I'm hungover.
31/10/2020, 10:18 - Wezz: Lol, the odds.
31/10/2020, 10:18 - Noone: Kent school of English? I've never heard of it
31/10/2020, 10:21 - Noone: You sure this isn't a cover story so they can send over a special operations team under the guise of students to capture our beach side arcades and amusements?
31/10/2020, 10:23 - Paul: Well tbf they are quite jealous of beaches over here
31/10/2020, 10:25 - Noone: Germany being a landlocked nation I can imagine they fancy our seasonal bouncy castles on the sand and them little wooden boat rides where you pull on that rope to make you go higher and higher it's well fun init
31/10/2020, 10:26 - Noone: You all been on them wooden boat swings don't even lie
31/10/2020, 10:26 - Paul: It's not completely landlocked. There's sea in the north
31/10/2020, 10:26 - Noone: We're off that now, the conversation has moved onto the little wooden boat swings with the ropes to make you swing up and down you know
31/10/2020, 10:27 - Paul: Yeah Germany doesn't have those it's illegal
31/10/2020, 10:27 - Noone: That's well sad
31/10/2020, 10:27 - Paul: They are antigovernment don't you know
31/10/2020, 10:28 - Noone: They're anti gravity more like, those things will send a little nigga to space if you time your swings right
31/10/2020, 10:29 - Paul: This guy still believes in gravity. Lol big science brainwashing
31/10/2020, 10:30 - Noone: Only in Broadstairs, it's caused by your MUM because she's so FAT
31/10/2020, 10:30 - Wezz: My family could never afford for me to go on em. That or they were the "gravity is just a theory" type.
31/10/2020, 10:30 - Noone: Don't make me sad, I've got me Donalds brekkie on the way
31/10/2020, 10:31 - Paul: Same man... "next time..."
31/10/2020, 10:31 - Paul: There never was a next time
31/10/2020, 10:32 - Noone: :'(
31/10/2020, 10:32 - Mike: That's every morning Jack
31/10/2020, 10:32 - Wezz: Take pleasure in sending my nephews on the big fuck off bouncy castles in Broadstairs. It's practically a vertical slide they just jump off the top and dgaf.
31/10/2020, 10:32 - Paul: My mum could beat up your mum
31/10/2020, 10:32 - Paul: Has he figured out the toaster yet?
31/10/2020, 10:32 - Noone: My mum's not a UFC world champion so probably not
31/10/2020, 10:33 - Wezz: We can't, we've got to get to Nana's.
_we didn't go to Nana's_
31/10/2020, 10:33 - Noone: Toaster is easy, I just never have to little refills for it
31/10/2020, 10:33 - Noone: The*
31/10/2020, 10:33 - Wezz: You can put anything in the toaster if you try hard enough
31/10/2020, 10:34 - Noone: False
31/10/2020, 10:34 - Paul: Everything except love
31/10/2020, 10:34 - Wezz: Love is lost in the toaster. It's like a mini furnace of emotion
31/10/2020, 10:35 - Noone: My degus were barking last night. Googled why they might be going it and turns out it's the season for HORNY
31/10/2020, 10:35 - Wezz: Scolding your ambition to ride the wooden boat ride. It was the straw Sam! You caused the break up with your stupid dare devil desire for vertigo
31/10/2020, 10:36 - Noone: Fucking lol
31/10/2020, 10:36 - Wezz: When's your season for horny?
31/10/2020, 10:36 - Noone: Around 11:50 every second Wednesday of the month
31/10/2020, 10:36 - Wezz: Piper's just been secretly fingering their bums again
31/10/2020, 10:37 - Wezz: Convenient.. that's when Animal Hospital airs on ITV4
31/10/2020, 10:38 - Noone: Hard to make it a secret with his long ass boney fingers. They'll slither down the stairs at night making an arthritic cracking as they slide under my door and into my batty slice. All the while pipers upstairs feeling things out with his eyes closed humming the tune to the dam busters
31/10/2020, 10:40 - Wezz: Loool, okay you win. Fucking dambusters
31/10/2020, 11:11 - Wezz: https://v.redd.it/6i4sqr5vpaw51
31/10/2020, 11:13 - Paul: Jesus Christ lol
31/10/2020, 11:15 - Paul: Are these teams in the world's final the expected finalists?
31/10/2020, 11:15 - Noone: Hehe
31/10/2020, 11:17 - Wezz: I'm pretty sure no.

G2 was favoured and they went out in semis
31/10/2020, 11:17 - Paul: Was gonna say I've never heard of these orgs
31/10/2020, 11:18 - Dayle: <Media omitted>
31/10/2020, 11:23 - Wezz: League is genuinely the most boring esport.
31/10/2020, 11:23 - Noone: Game*
31/10/2020, 11:24 - Mike: Among Us esport when
31/10/2020, 11:25 - Mike: Paul could be a crowd favourite, dead first every round
31/10/2020, 11:25 - Wezz: Majority of games are just painstakingly predictable snowballing. Very little audience only info, e.g. hidden impactful tech that only the audience know. That shit makes for fun watching.
31/10/2020, 11:27 - Mike: Add some audience interaction, if enough people click the button the eater changes colour
31/10/2020, 11:27 - Mike: Water*
31/10/2020, 11:29 - Wezz: I vote they let us unplug someone's keyboard once per game for 5 seconds.
31/10/2020, 11:30 - Mike: Gotta give the player a chance, it resets keybinds to default for 5 seconds
31/10/2020, 11:32 - Wezz: You remember the old reversy controls you could get in platformers. Just give us some of those
31/10/2020, 12:43 - Paul: +1
31/10/2020, 12:43 - Paul: This shit is uncanny
31/10/2020, 12:58 - Paul: Ah man, RIP Sean Connery absolute legend
31/10/2020, 13:05 - Wezz: Ah RIP, I remember him being an idol then I watched some interview where he says a woman needs a good slapping about
31/10/2020, 13:05 - Wezz: Then he reached messiah level worship for me
31/10/2020, 13:06 - Wezz: jkjk, 90 years old is mad.
31/10/2020, 13:09 - Wezz: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzXkbJwrN38

RIP, last true feminist
31/10/2020, 13:14 - Wezz: That fact he's a Sir is icing on the patriarchal cake.
31/10/2020, 13:15 - Paul: Yeah but he was James Bond
31/10/2020, 13:17 - Paul: If James Bond can't slap women then what is this all for? What are we even doing?
31/10/2020, 13:17 - Wezz: Can't wait for *Jill* 'black, one leg, rare form of skin cancer, adopted, abused, partially sighted, _they_ pronoun' *Bond* to take his place.
31/10/2020, 13:18 - Paul: Did you just assume their gender

31/10/2020, 13:56 - Noone: I'm in an uber to pick up my car and this moron keeps tapping the breaks and then accelerating to stay at 30mph
31/10/2020, 13:56 - Noone: I fucking hate this country
31/10/2020, 13:57 - Noone: Like he thinks the throttle is a binary system, on or off what the fuck is going on
31/10/2020, 13:58 - Noone: Getting carsick, pray for me brothers
31/10/2020, 14:02 - Mike: I hate that feeling
31/10/2020, 14:02 - Lockers: My mate drives like this and there's nothing more infuriating
31/10/2020, 14:03 - Lockers: Just as infuriating to follow as it is to be a passenger
31/10/2020, 16:02 - Mike: https://gfycat.com/agonizingspicyhylaeosaurus
31/10/2020, 17:02 - Noone: Sounds like most of the single mothers at my secondary school, bar the futuristic bit

31/10/2020, 17:29 - Noone: Ffs
31/10/2020, 17:29 - Kirky: Except this time it's cold and shit and wet
31/10/2020, 19:41 - Kirky: One of you guys needs to make an app that lists what movies and tv shows are on what streaming service
31/10/2020, 19:41 - Wezz: already existttttsssssss
31/10/2020, 19:41 - Kirky: We'll take a 75% cut for the idea
31/10/2020, 19:41 - Kirky: What's it called?
31/10/2020, 19:41 - Wezz: JustWatch
31/10/2020, 19:41 - Wezz: I think

31/10/2020, 19:42 - Wezz: SORRY MATE
31/10/2020, 19:42 - Wezz: Back to the drawing board
31/10/2020, 19:46 - Kirky: Damn
31/10/2020, 19:46 - Kirky: Well thanks. We just sat here watching trailers
31/10/2020, 19:49 - Wezz: You should watch......... COHERENCE
31/10/2020, 19:49 - Wezz: Great little flick, not that well known. Not too scary but some mystery/weird elements.
31/10/2020, 19:55 - Kirky: We watching crank

31/10/2020, 20:19 - Paul: Love a good game of chest

31/10/2020, 20:37 - Wezz: I've have you know, I've been subbed to r/chess for at least 6 months now doing those little puzzles that get upvoted. One day I'll get to show off the accumulation of knowledge üß†
31/10/2020, 20:45 - Paul: Can play with you a bit if you want. Could maybe give some pointers
31/10/2020, 20:48 - Noone: This retard couldn't spell his own name
31/10/2020, 20:48 - Paul: I don't think that's a chess prerequisite tbf
31/10/2020, 20:49 - Wezz: I'm totally not there yet, have zero knowledge of overarching aims (other than just take material lol). Defo down for a few games soon though
31/10/2020, 20:50 - Wezz: if you give me mate puzzles i'll fair much better lol
31/10/2020, 20:54 - Paul: <Media omitted>
31/10/2020, 20:55 - Wezz: I saw that yesterday - read the thread and everything. mate in like 28 or somethign
31/10/2020, 20:55 - Wezz: or maybe i'm wrong..
31/10/2020, 20:55 - Lockers: Oh fuck off
31/10/2020, 20:56 - Paul: Yeah but there's a tactic that gives white a big advantage. Just a few moves
31/10/2020, 20:56 - Paul: And Yeah it was posted yesterday I think lol
31/10/2020, 20:57 - Wezz: yeah, it was a weird underpromotion of pawn to something
31/10/2020, 20:57 - Wezz: i can't remember exactly
31/10/2020, 20:58 - Wezz: literally my only knowledge of chess comes from /r/chess in last 6 months...
31/10/2020, 20:58 - Wezz: and anarchychess
31/10/2020, 20:59 - Paul: Yeah that's it. After the room recaptures you check with your queen on the left side (a7). Then you underpromote to a knight which forks the queen and king. So you go into endgame up a knight
31/10/2020, 20:59 - Paul: Rook*
31/10/2020, 20:59 - Paul: It's super rare to have underpromotions
31/10/2020, 20:59 - Paul: To the point where move people have it set to autopromote as queen online
31/10/2020, 21:00 - Wezz: yeah, makes sense. and i guess only thing it'd ever be is a knight. as queen = bishop = rook
31/10/2020, 21:01 - Wezz: unless you wanna style on noobs
31/10/2020, 21:19 - Paul: You ok hun
31/10/2020, 22:18 - Piper: Who's about?

01/11/2020, 08:35 - Lockers: Kirky what's happened to you? Gone full Boy George
01/11/2020, 08:44 - Paul: Neil_m the pro csgo coach demonstrating how to keep his cool
01/11/2020, 09:14 - Paul: I've listened to this 5 times wtf are you trying to say
01/11/2020, 10:50 - Noone: I grew up
01/11/2020, 10:51 - Noone: What is this drunk trying to say?
01/11/2020, 11:05 - Wezz: I can translate Mike don't worry guys.

I believe he's referring to the 1962 novelty song *"Monster Mash"* by Bobby "Boris" Pickett.

Followed by an uncertain countdown, it appesrs more for his own courage than to set the expectations of those watching.
01/11/2020, 11:07 - Mike: I've just had to listen to myself, how do you guys ever hear whatever I say normally?
01/11/2020, 11:07 - Mike: So nasal
01/11/2020, 11:09 - Wezz: How are you actually awake?
01/11/2020, 11:10 - Mike: Who says I am? These responses may be muscle memory at this point

01/11/2020, 12:17 - Dayle: Yeaaah that's cool man, dub rush or legal wall?
01/11/2020, 13:31 - Wezz: Legal tunnel near mine. Never usually this packed though. Hard to breathe down there üò∑
01/11/2020, 15:19 - Wezz: Just watched this, reminded me of my first beer (AY @447758520258?)
01/11/2020, 15:54 - Lockers: Wheyyyy good one m8
01/11/2020, 15:59 - Wezz: Thanks mate, that reminded me of my first beer too.
01/11/2020, 15:59 - Lockers: Wheyyyy another good one m8
01/11/2020, 15:59 - Wezz: Thanks mate, that reminded me of my first beer too.
01/11/2020, 16:00 - Lockers: I see a loop forming here...
01/11/2020, 16:00 - Wezz: Thanks again mate, that reminded me of my first beer.

01/11/2020, 16:54 - Wezz: I didn't realise postman Pat's head was _so long_
01/11/2020, 16:55 - Kirky: he IS the vibrator
01/11/2020, 16:55 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
01/11/2020, 17:02 - Mike: Dat nose puts me to shame
01/11/2020, 17:04 - Wezz: At least he can substitute his nose in when he gets tired, yours falls in an awkward middle ground.
01/11/2020, 17:07 - Mike: I hope you're referring to my nose here
01/11/2020, 17:08 - Wezz: Well the thing you don't know, is that Pat has to urinate from his nostrils.
01/11/2020, 17:08 - Wezz: It's part of the deal he made with God.
01/11/2020, 17:09 - Wezz: Just like turning on your bathroom taps.
01/11/2020, 17:19 - Mike: You just gonna let Wezz died your homie like that kirky?
01/11/2020, 17:19 - Mike: Diss*

02/11/2020, 12:49 - Dayle: <Media omitted>
02/11/2020, 12:57 - Paul: Lot of shady stuff with management conflict of interest and interviews with players when they aren't allowed to say negative things
02/11/2020, 13:29 - Paul: Was thinking about taking Wednesday off and sitting up to watch the world end on Tuesday night, anyone fancy joining?
02/11/2020, 13:29 - Dayle: <Media omitted>
02/11/2020, 13:29 - Dayle: Whata ending?
02/11/2020, 13:29 - Paul: The world
02/11/2020, 13:30 - Dayle: Why?
02/11/2020, 13:31 - Nathan: Fuck that looks spicy! 32" curved swit swoo!
02/11/2020, 13:48 - Paul: It's election night
02/11/2020, 13:48 - Paul: Already got my popcorn
02/11/2020, 13:49 - Mike: Results won't be for a few days right?
02/11/2020, 13:49 - Paul: It's gonna take weeks but that's not gonna stop the drama
02/11/2020, 13:49 - Paul: Bound to be riots
02/11/2020, 13:51 - Paul: Trump is likely to take the early lead because of democrats mostly doing mail in ballots. Trump has pushed that they are invalid. He's gonna claim he's won and I think it's gonna be a bit crazy
02/11/2020, 13:57 - Wezz: I don't get that perspective tbh. Like, people are scared he's going to refuse to leave? Is that even a possibility? Surely they just go, out you get mr 70 yo man.
02/11/2020, 13:57 - Wezz: Armed guards and all
02/11/2020, 14:29 - Paul: That's the exciting part. Who knows what he'll do next!
02/11/2020, 14:30 - Nathan: Fire the nukes!
02/11/2020, 14:32 - Paul: He can certainly try. The guy has so many indictments waiting for him when he steps down lol. It's why he's building this narrative that If he loses then it's fake
02/11/2020, 14:51 - Wezz: I see that more as ego protecting but I guess it could be both. Really think people are overestimating an individual's (citizen at that point) power.
02/11/2020, 14:51 - Paul: I never said its gonna work lol
02/11/2020, 14:52 - Wezz: Well the narrative is fear mongering imo
02/11/2020, 14:52 - Qck: Many indictments, many debts
02/11/2020, 14:53 - Paul: It doesn't make any difference to us. I just think most signs point to a crazy night
02/11/2020, 14:53 - Wezz: More concerned with the reaction of the gun wielding far right lunatics üòÆ
02/11/2020, 14:54 - Qck: Many men wish death upon me
02/11/2020, 14:54 - Wezz: Yeah it's gonna be amazing entertainment. Love election night and US TV
02/11/2020, 14:54 - Paul: True
02/11/2020, 14:54 - Wezz: Can multiwatch fox and cnn
02/11/2020, 14:55 - Paul: Great way to have a fucking stroke lmao
02/11/2020, 14:57 - Wezz: Get to see two different election nights
02/11/2020, 15:03 - Wezz: Biden about 75% chance of winning according to oddsmakers..

03/11/2020, 08:59 - Mike: Cgp does a good voting system vid, very similar. Basically fptp is shit.
03/11/2020, 09:09 - Wezz: Yeah I like cgp grey's stuff too. This guy takes it to the next level with simulation/visualisation of outcomes. His old ecosystem stuff is well worth watching was surprised by some of the results.
03/11/2020, 09:12 - Mike: How is bitcoin back over 10k each again

03/11/2020, 18:59 - Lockers: I hate you
03/11/2020, 18:59 - Dayle: Who is up for getting written off on a school night
03/11/2020, 18:59 - Lockers: ON the lockers? Mad people
03/11/2020, 19:07 - Dayle: Who's up for some games i wanna get shilletted on league
03/11/2020, 19:07 - Dayle: Just dropped 100 quid on valorant skinds

04/11/2020, 00:09 - Wezz: Kind of a new era being able to watch election results via your favourite streamer. So many options on YouTube + Twitch
04/11/2020, 00:10 - Paul: Yeah I was watching destiny a bit
04/11/2020, 00:22 - Wezz: I watched some of him. Turns out im banned from his chat for some reason.

04/11/2020, 01:24 - Paul: Joe Rogan has a stream going on YouTube
04/11/2020, 07:31 - Paul: Dude trump just fucking called it and said he's going to supreme court to stop the rest of the votes
04/11/2020, 07:31 - Paul: I fucking knew it
04/11/2020, 07:34 - Lockers: üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ
04/11/2020, 08:10 - Mike: Trump gaining votes from Latino voters while Biden taking older white folks votes is pretty interesting
04/11/2020, 08:25 - Noone: Trump
Kept
Florida
04/11/2020, 08:29 - Noone: United States of Trump
04/11/2020, 08:31 - Noone: Betting odds have * FLIPPED*
04/11/2020, 08:37 - Mike: Yeh they're now super close, basically 50/50 with small favour to trump
04/11/2020, 08:37 - Dayle: Crazy
04/11/2020, 08:37 - Noone: KING TRUMP
04/11/2020, 08:39 - Dayle: I don't really get what's happening, is trump winning or
04/11/2020, 08:39 - Mike: Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene, the first open supporter of the QAnon conspiracy theory, has won a seat in Congress - she stood unchallenged.
04/11/2020, 08:39 - Noone: Yes for the next thousand years
04/11/2020, 08:40 - Noone: *HAHAHAHA*
04/11/2020, 08:40 - Mike: America has its highest ranking openly transgender elected official after Sarah McBride was elected to a seat in Delaware's state legislature.
04/11/2020, 08:40 - Noone: I remember laughing at q anon larpers on Pol and now there's one in Congress
04/11/2020, 08:41 - Noone: 40% kill themselves so it won't be there long
04/11/2020, 08:42 - Dayle: Fucking Americans
04/11/2020, 08:42 - Dayle: This happens when democracy has dumb users ü§£ü§£
04/11/2020, 08:43 - Noone: This happens when democracy has users
04/11/2020, 08:43 - Noone: Biden could still win with mail in ballots
04/11/2020, 08:44 - Mike: Biden & Dems expected a larger share of votes, Trump doing better than expected but still incredibly close. Largely mail in votes uncounted which everyone is expecting to favour democrats could be the deciding factor but won't be fully counted for days or weeks.
04/11/2020, 08:45 - Dayle: Thank you
04/11/2020, 08:45 - Noone: Won't matter in fptp
04/11/2020, 08:46 - Mike: Could be a 2016 repeat, majority vote but not enough for the win via elector college. Is the system outdated? Built in a time when no TV or internet existed. Big questions for little America, back to you in the studio Tom.
04/11/2020, 08:46 - Noone: Thanks Mike. Onto Dayle with the Esports
04/11/2020, 08:47 - Mike: Electoral*
04/11/2020, 08:47 - Dayle: Its all facked init mate

04/11/2020, 08:48 - Wezz: Yeah we need to get more patients to vote ffs
04/11/2020, 08:48 - Wezz: @447758520258 WHY ARENT THE KIDS VOTING?
04/11/2020, 08:48 - Wezz: @447943624891 SORT THE WANNABE CARRIBBEANS OUT
04/11/2020, 08:48 - Mike: After having Lockers as a teacher I'm surprised more don't give up and live in the woods let alone vote
04/11/2020, 08:49 - Noone: Can we just accept the dementia man has lost and I can get Pol back to its usual calm state
04/11/2020, 08:49 - Mike: Which
04/11/2020, 08:49 - Derren: Why you even watching this shit
04/11/2020, 08:50 - Wezz: Why are the polls always hilariously wrong. Just makes everyone panic. Actually brings me so much joy.
04/11/2020, 08:50 - Noone: The one with cum in his head
04/11/2020, 08:50 - Dayle: The breakfast roll from McDonald's
04/11/2020, 08:50 - Noone: Nice
04/11/2020, 08:50 - Dayle: Is quite nice, that is all
04/11/2020, 08:50 - Mike: It's fun, like watching your neighbours fight in the street
04/11/2020, 08:50 - Noone: Is it new??
04/11/2020, 08:50 - Noone: Mike saw a lot of that, growing up in a favela
04/11/2020, 08:51 - Derren: Was gonna say the same thing Jack
04/11/2020, 08:51 - Dayle: Yeah new one
04/11/2020, 08:51 - Mike: It does remind me of home, simpler times
04/11/2020, 08:51 - Noone: His mum would send him round the house of whichever neighbor was losing the fight and steal their onions
04/11/2020, 08:51 - Wezz: Melasma and cum mmmmmmm
04/11/2020, 08:51 - Derren: Mike grew up with this guy https://youtu.be/E8U5N4xzLTo
04/11/2020, 08:51 - Derren: Same estate init
04/11/2020, 08:52 - Noone: "they're better than their apples MOIK, NAH GO AND NAB EM BEFORE THE ROZZERS GET ERE'"
04/11/2020, 08:53 - Dayle: So, who's excited for lock down?
04/11/2020, 08:54 - Dayle: Only one more until Christmas very exciting
04/11/2020, 08:54 - Mike: Can confirm, estate chav family
04/11/2020, 08:54 - Mike: It'll be till after Christmas too xw
04/11/2020, 08:54 - Mike: Dw*
04/11/2020, 09:07 - Lockers: I remember my first beer
04/11/2020, 09:07 - Noone: The reason they're not voting is because you've not yet forgotten your first beer?
04/11/2020, 09:08 - Noone: So what you're saying is if we inception that memory away the electoral college with grow to the biggest it can be in voters under 25
04/11/2020, 09:10 - Wezz: *Zimmer intensifies*
04/11/2020, 09:59 - Noone: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwF229U2ba8
04/11/2020, 10:32 - Paul: Where are you seeing that trump is the favourite? Taking Wisconsin means Biden just needs to confirm Nevada and he'll almost certainly win Pennsylvania. I think he's still most likely to win
04/11/2020, 10:33 - Noone: Typical liberal. Where is your faith?
04/11/2020, 10:33 - Noone: God Emperor Donald won't let us win to demonic taint
04/11/2020, 10:34 - Noone: No wait-
04/11/2020, 10:34 - Paul: Yeah literally that's why riots have started üò´
04/11/2020, 10:35 - Noone: People will riot over whatever Facebook tells them to
04/11/2020, 10:36 - Paul: Yes trying to steal the election is equivalent to bring back Seinfeld or we riot!
04/11/2020, 10:37 - Noone: Literally is
04/11/2020, 10:38 - Paul: Both infringe on my civil liberties! We demand democracy and Jerry quips!
04/11/2020, 10:39 - James: Jack's opinion is invalid as it might hurt people's feelings
04/11/2020, 10:40 - Paul: Agreed
04/11/2020, 10:41 - Noone: You see! You see everyone! This is suppression of the masses! Censorship! *LISTEN TO MEEEEE*
04/11/2020, 10:41 - Paul: Sorry James has spoken
04/11/2020, 10:42 - Noone: ___message suppressed due to potential for offense___
04/11/2020, 10:42 - Noone: ___message suppressed due to potential for offense___
04/11/2020, 10:42 - Noone: ___message suppressed due to potential for offense___
04/11/2020, 10:43 - Noone: REEEEEE___message suppressed due to potential for offense___
04/11/2020, 10:43 - Paul: I bet the second one was particularly inflammatory
04/11/2020, 10:49 - Wezz: Oddsmakers say trump was favourite around 4 hours ago. Now it's pretty even, slight (%5 edge Biden)
04/11/2020, 10:50 - Paul: Crazy
04/11/2020, 10:52 - Wezz: Trump went up to 75% likelihood of winning 3 hours ago. So obv swinging back now. Pretty mad coinflip
04/11/2020, 10:52 - Paul: What caused that?
04/11/2020, 10:52 - Noone: ___message suppressed due to potential for offense___
04/11/2020, 10:52 - Wezz: Guess report of Florida? I haven't been following too closely
04/11/2020, 10:53 - Paul: Nah Florida wasn't surprising and was pretty early. I watched like all night fell asleep at 6
04/11/2020, 10:54 - Wezz: Florida was a swing state in polls. Idk
04/11/2020, 10:55 - Paul: It was one of the "must wins" in order for trump to stand a chance. Biden didn't *need* Florida. It wasn't his necessary path. But trump winning it put him in contention
04/11/2020, 10:56 - Noone: ___message suppressed due to potential for offense___
04/11/2020, 10:58 - Wezz: Ah, maybe that + a different state then. Idk. Whole thing is a mess. Let's RFID chip the nation and make beep voting mandatory to buy food.
04/11/2020, 10:58 - Wezz: I've gone full circle
04/11/2020, 10:58 - Wezz: Suppress me daddy
04/11/2020, 10:59 - Paul: Its mad how out of sync the polls have been to the electorate twice now. Do people actively lie a lot? Or is it being ashamed to admit it?
04/11/2020, 11:00 - Noone: ___MESSAGE SUPPRESSED DUE TO CONSIDERABLE POTENTIAL FOR OFFENSE___
04/11/2020, 11:01 - Paul: Whenever Jack types a message all I see is hunter2
04/11/2020, 11:01 - Wezz: It's conducted by a bunch of out of touch political lifers
04/11/2020, 11:02 - Paul: But it has never been so off before
04/11/2020, 11:02 - Wezz: Because it's the first time we have a person in power who is not representative of the political system.
04/11/2020, 11:02 - Wezz: (Imo)
04/11/2020, 11:03 - Paul: Reagan too
04/11/2020, 11:03 - Paul: He was an actor
04/11/2020, 11:03 - Wezz: Yeah he was a Hollywood guy right
04/11/2020, 11:03 - Wezz: I guess modern era version nowadays, power of crowds/social media
04/11/2020, 11:04 - Wezz: All this stuff creates additional volatility
04/11/2020, 11:04 - Paul: But why would that change how the polls work? How can the data be so unreliable
04/11/2020, 11:04 - Paul: Unless people are lying
04/11/2020, 11:04 - Wezz: .
04/11/2020, 11:04 - Paul: Or they aren't getting a proportional demographic
04/11/2020, 11:05 - Paul: I hope they had at least 1 disabled Hispanic woman in their test groups
04/11/2020, 11:05 - Wezz: What's the phase these days.. "don't vote for what you fled"
04/11/2020, 11:05 - Wezz: Eurgh, makes my skin crawl that.
04/11/2020, 11:06 - Wezz: Most manipulative statement it's just dirty ü§¢
04/11/2020, 11:06 - Wezz: Up there with 'Islam is right about women'
04/11/2020, 11:06 - Wezz: ___MESSAGE SUPPRESSED DUE TO CONSIDERABLE POTENTIAL FOR OFFENSE___
04/11/2020, 12:01 - Paul: Can we all agree that the funniest scenario from this point on would be:

1. Trump wins legitimately
2. He forgets to cancel his supreme court efforts to stop the vote.
3. Supreme court passes that rule.
4. Trump loses because of himself
04/11/2020, 12:06 - Mike: When people say polls
04/11/2020, 12:06 - Mike: Do you mean majority vote or electoral college? Most polls report the majority which was roughly accurate in 2016
04/11/2020, 12:07 - Mike: Electoral college polls, do they even exist? Would be mad complex
04/11/2020, 12:07 - Paul: I think the models work on polling data collected early. And they are then used as data points to simulate the electoral college results
04/11/2020, 12:08 - Mike: I think I remember reading they are bad at predicting college voting intention but good at flat majority
04/11/2020, 12:09 - Paul: They just use location data and election choice and fit it into a map model
04/11/2020, 12:09 - Paul: They can never be accurate but up until trump they've had a high confidence interval
04/11/2020, 12:11 - Mike: Presidents Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama both used rooms at the White House as a backdrop for their political campaigns. Still they tried to make a distinction between campaign activities and their work as president. On election night in the Trump White House, that line seemed to have been obliterated.
04/11/2020, 12:11 - Mike: Favourite part so far
04/11/2020, 12:16 - Mike: How much for "Biden wins and nominates Trump as VP"?
04/11/2020, 13:09 - Paul: "Biden should sell sleepy Joe pillows"
04/11/2020, 13:53 - Wezz: It's so funny reading Reddit right now.
04/11/2020, 13:54 - Wezz: HoW iS mY eChO cHaMbEr So MiSrEpReSeNtAtIvE?!
04/11/2020, 14:19 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
04/11/2020, 14:20 - Mike: Dun dun dunnnn
04/11/2020, 14:21 - Mike: <Media omitted>
04/11/2020, 14:24 - Mike: British politician Nigel Farage ‚Äì who supports President Trump ‚Äì was speaking about the US election and told BBC News: ‚ÄúThe evidence for voter fraud from postal voting is there for all to see, we know it ourselves on our side of the pond.‚Äù

Glad we got Nigel back in politics, always a sound of reason
04/11/2020, 14:24 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
04/11/2020, 14:24 - Kirky: hes already back nigga https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/11/01/exclusive-nigel-farage-relaunch-brexit-party-reform-uk-new-anti/
04/11/2020, 14:25 - Mike: Reminds me of shy Tory syndrome
04/11/2020, 14:25 - Wezz: Totally, same conservative bs
04/11/2020, 14:25 - Kirky: ofc dude why say youre voting trump if youre gonna get beat u the big black dude outside?
04/11/2020, 14:32 - Paul: Isn't he too busy being suffocated?
04/11/2020, 14:35 - Mike: Everyone's talking about trump Vs Biden, why is no one talking about Kanye?
04/11/2020, 14:35 - Paul: Because that stopped being funny and I'm worried about him
04/11/2020, 14:35 - Wezz: Kanye's talking about Kanye
04/11/2020, 14:36 - Wezz: Touch√©
04/11/2020, 14:36 - Wezz: I will bet someone 3 shots that Biden will win this shit show.
04/11/2020, 14:37 - Paul: Already got a tenner against Julia
04/11/2020, 14:37 - Paul: Sure I'll bet you too
04/11/2020, 14:37 - Paul: Wait no
04/11/2020, 14:37 - Paul: You need to say trump
04/11/2020, 14:38 - Paul: I think most likely scenario is it's so close it's settled in the courts
04/11/2020, 14:40 - Mike: What are the courts gonna do? Go count the votes by hand?
04/11/2020, 14:41 - Paul: Happened with bush gore
04/11/2020, 14:41 - Paul: They can force recounts and discount votes that are contentious for various reasons
04/11/2020, 14:41 - Paul: Ends up in the hands of the supreme court
04/11/2020, 14:44 - Mike: Oh man imagine the supreme court discounting mail in votes
04/11/2020, 14:44 - Mike: That'd be a spicy year
04/11/2020, 14:44 - Wezz: Jeeze, I mean. Trying to not seem like a brainwashed cunt here, but I don't really like these late appearing postal bs. But also didn't trump mess with the postal service and stuff. Just so wishy washy.
04/11/2020, 14:45 - Mike: Late appearing votes?
04/11/2020, 14:45 - Wezz: Social security number, online ID verification. Vote online.
04/11/2020, 14:46 - Wezz: My understanding was the mail in votes don't arrive until various times after election close.
04/11/2020, 14:46 - Mike: You think that would add trust to this system? People can't deal with paper fraud let alone electrical
04/11/2020, 14:47 - Wezz: I think it would add accountability. I mean the whole thing is a fuck mess let's be real.
04/11/2020, 14:47 - Mike: Yeh but that's not unexpected considering the massive influx of mail voting this year I'd expect
04/11/2020, 14:47 - Wezz: Block chain it, link to social security. phone pic/vid required as part of registration process.
04/11/2020, 14:49 - Mike: "dem Der technocrats stealing our democracy"
04/11/2020, 14:49 - Paul: The narrative that postal votes are flawed has only become a political issue since it became more popular for one side to use it lol
04/11/2020, 14:49 - Wezz: I don't think they're flawed. Just messy
04/11/2020, 14:49 - Paul: Paper ballots are even messier imo
04/11/2020, 14:49 - Wezz: Are postal vote deadlines earlier? And then make sure everything's in one room at midnight and lock the door.
04/11/2020, 14:49 - Wezz: Exam style yknow
04/11/2020, 14:50 - Paul: Depends on the state and if they were postmarked
04/11/2020, 14:50 - Paul: <Media omitted>
04/11/2020, 14:51 - Wezz: I just don't like the late delivery stuff. Fix it Paul
04/11/2020, 14:51 - Wezz: Also your girlfriend speaks American. Get out
04/11/2020, 14:51 - Mike: Even if he doesn't win, he's got nearly half the countries vote ü§£
04/11/2020, 14:52 - Mike: Eat your sad victory pie Paul
04/11/2020, 14:52 - Paul: Biden winning isn't a victory it's just a notdefeat
04/11/2020, 14:52 - Mike: Eat your notdefeat pie Paul
04/11/2020, 14:52 - Wezz: Nah his core radical die hard fans are the problematic ones..
04/11/2020, 14:53 - Paul: I dunno I'm more on the side of every vote should be counted. Its bad enough that they are weighted differently by state
04/11/2020, 14:53 - Wezz: Not the other 49% of the population that think differently than me
04/11/2020, 14:54 - Wezz: Completely agree every vote needs to be counted. But sort it the fuck out so that the votes are in one place by one cut off time.
04/11/2020, 14:54 - Paul: Fuck those guys
04/11/2020, 14:54 - Paul: I'd say sure it's a frustrating issue. But also that it's of secondary importance. I'd never sacrifice a vote just because it's inconvenient
04/11/2020, 14:55 - Wezz: @447757709019's gonna find a bag of 200k postal ballots next week that we can add.
04/11/2020, 14:56 - Wezz: It's an issue that can be fixed independently of voter participation.
04/11/2020, 14:57 - Paul: Sure fine. But why does it matter right now? Everyone knew the rules going in. Fix it later
04/11/2020, 14:57 - Paul: Only does harm to add the narrative that they are somehow less valid atm
04/11/2020, 14:58 - Wezz: Yeah, I guess my point is that it's an oversight.
04/11/2020, 14:59 - Wezz: Doesn't matter who wins to me. But long as we improve the shit system in the process.
04/11/2020, 15:00 - Mike: I mean fptp warrants action more than mail voting surely, not like it's one or the other but definitely prioritise
04/11/2020, 15:00 - Paul: Fuck fptp
04/11/2020, 15:00 - Wezz: Fptp is shit. Can agree on that
04/11/2020, 15:01 - Wezz: Now RFID chip babies already
04/11/2020, 15:04 - Mike: A suggestion at one of visas Hackathons was to RFID homeless people to a bank account, that way you can make sure they don't spend money on drugs or alcohol I
04/11/2020, 15:04 - Mike: Blade runner future for homeless people
04/11/2020, 15:07 - Paul: Socialism would be an easier transition
04/11/2020, 15:15 - Wezz: Nah, I vote we beep the homeless.
04/11/2020, 15:16 - Wezz: BEEEEP
04/11/2020, 15:17 - Mike: Just bonk my phone on his head "here you are wretch, aren't I such a moral person?"
04/11/2020, 15:17 - Paul: But you don't install apps
04/11/2020, 15:18 - Mike: It's a custom homebrew, it actually just makes a beep noise and doesn't pay them
04/11/2020, 15:19 - Wezz: Fuck YES
04/11/2020, 15:22 - Wezz: This concept is tragically upsetting to me. Feel sick at the thought.
04/11/2020, 15:32 - Wezz: *Beeeeep*
04/11/2020, 15:38 - Paul: Mike walks away giggling as the homeless man sheds a tear that someone was so kind. Finally he can get that piece of bread and make it through the week
04/11/2020, 15:39 - Paul: Mike was later heard saying "who would go to LAN on their own"
04/11/2020, 15:39 - James: Who would die of starvation on their own?
04/11/2020, 15:39 - Paul: Simply eat your friends
04/11/2020, 16:01 - Kirky: Csn trump win already so i can start lynching black people ffs
04/11/2020, 16:35 - Derren: @447943624891 Why are you surprised that minorities are voting for trump :o
04/11/2020, 16:35 - Noone: LOL
04/11/2020, 16:36 - Paul: Because he's a racist fuck who would shoot or deport them if he could?
04/11/2020, 16:37 - Derren: Where did you get this rhetoric from
04/11/2020, 16:37 - Derren: From what I understand he doesn't want ILLEGAL immigrants in the country
04/11/2020, 16:37 - Derren: Not anybody that isn't "white" whatever that means
04/11/2020, 16:37 - Paul: Are you joking? From following his actions and words for the last 4 years
04/11/2020, 16:38 - Derren: Because he wants to build a wall to stop people entering the country illegally? xD
04/11/2020, 16:38 - Derren: Has he placed a ban on applying for american citizenship?
04/11/2020, 16:40 - Paul: No more related to the detainment and policies in the boarders. His comments on foreign nationals, his Muslim ban, his active support of the proud boys, his support of white supremacists, his comments on the death penalty of the central park 5 that's he's refused to go back on, his constant barrage of negativity towards Mexican immigrants
04/11/2020, 16:40 - Paul: For a start
04/11/2020, 16:42 - Paul: Do you actually believe this? Have you seen what an incendiary lie this was based on contractor estimates? This was a further narrative to rile up his base
04/11/2020, 16:42 - Mike: Those are all illegal minorities Paul, specially those illegal Muslims
04/11/2020, 16:43 - Derren: Doesn't Hilary have ties to the leader of the KKK?
04/11/2020, 16:43 - Derren: ü§®
04/11/2020, 16:43 - Paul: Oh you got me?
04/11/2020, 16:44 - Kirky: https://observer.com/2017/01/barack-obama-policies-foundation-donald-trump-muslim-ban/ remember Obama started the Muslim ban
04/11/2020, 16:45 - Kirky: Not saying I agree with it but it isn't just trumpracistbadman
04/11/2020, 16:46 - Noone: Can't wait for trump to get rid of all the Turkish
04/11/2020, 16:47 - Paul: In December 2015, Obama signed into law the Visa Waiver Improvement Program and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act, which designated Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Somalia as areas of concern
04/11/2020, 16:47 - Kirky: I saw a picture saying Erdogan would support trump militarily if he refused to leave üòÇüòÇ
04/11/2020, 16:48 - Paul: I guess you could say he set the ground work right? But saying they are areas of concern is a bit different
04/11/2020, 16:48 - Noone: Like that cockroach could stop any developed nations army, lol
04/11/2020, 16:48 - Paul: Dunno I'd have to look into it more
04/11/2020, 16:48 - Mike: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election/video-donald-trump-racist-barack-obama-central-park-five-us-election-2020-b1426977.html

At least he doesn't use the n word tho you're right
04/11/2020, 16:49 - Mike: Can you imagine? America being invaded to restore democracy ü§£
04/11/2020, 16:50 - Kirky: Obama administration set a 6 month refugee ban from Iraq after 2 were caught fighting against American troops in iraq
04/11/2020, 16:50 - Kirky: That would really end 2020 in a high point üòÇüòÇ
04/11/2020, 16:50 - Paul: Didn't ISIS say something similar lol
04/11/2020, 16:51 - Kirky: As far as I remember trumps ban was also in response to an attack right ? He was probably much heavier handed and did a blanket ban than Obama though
04/11/2020, 16:51 - Paul: Ah right. Well fuck Obama too massive racist
04/11/2020, 16:51 - Noone: Can we all agree that accepting any Muslim person from any country is at this point _MESSAGE SUPPRESSED DUE TO 100% PROBABILITY OF PAUL RAGE_
04/11/2020, 16:52 - Paul: Agreed
04/11/2020, 16:52 - Noone: You with Freddie Paul?
04/11/2020, 16:53 - Paul: Of course
04/11/2020, 16:53 - Noone: If so:
Send good boi snaps
04/11/2020, 16:53 - Noone: Lets see he lovely chops
04/11/2020, 16:53 - Paul: <Media omitted>
04/11/2020, 16:53 - Noone: :3
04/11/2020, 16:54 - Paul: Best boy
04/11/2020, 16:54 - Noone: He looks fantastic. You on the other hand need a haircut, young man
04/11/2020, 16:54 - Paul: Definitely true
04/11/2020, 16:55 - Noone: Feel free anyone else to send pics of their dogs, but I know you've all so far, like me, failed in life by not getting a dog
04/11/2020, 16:55 - Derren: Muslims are fucked up
04/11/2020, 16:55 - Derren: Tbh Jews aren't that bad, only when they're all together in Israel
04/11/2020, 16:56 - Derren: I hate people that practise religion actively
04/11/2020, 16:56 - Mike: If your mumma could hear you now Abdullah
04/11/2020, 16:56 - Mike: Quick shoe to the head
04/11/2020, 16:56 - Mike: Slipper*
04/11/2020, 16:56 - Derren: She's too old for that now
04/11/2020, 16:56 - Noone: Derren is right ü§Æü§Æü§Æ
04/11/2020, 16:56 - Mike: Slow slipper it is then
04/11/2020, 16:56 - Derren: I hate skinheads too, fuck you
04/11/2020, 16:56 - Derren: üòÇ
04/11/2020, 16:57 - Noone: Europe heating up with anti Islam feels now too, which is nice to see
04/11/2020, 16:57 - Kirky: And the American Senate
04/11/2020, 16:57 - Noone: :<
04/11/2020, 16:57 - Noone: And Hollywood
04/11/2020, 16:57 - Kirky: And Hollywood
04/11/2020, 16:57 - Kirky: Lmfao
04/11/2020, 16:57 - Derren: üòÇ
04/11/2020, 16:58 - Derren: Well is that like a thing where most humans that are given power abuse it?
04/11/2020, 16:58 - Derren: power/money
04/11/2020, 16:58 - Noone: Yeah, Jews just have made it to the top for a while which means people hate them
04/11/2020, 16:58 - Derren: Normal Jews aren't that bad
04/11/2020, 16:59 - Derren: They have their own little communities and shit and at least help each other
04/11/2020, 16:59 - Derren: not like black people, killing each other 24/7 amirite @447835575116
04/11/2020, 16:59 - Wezz: Can I just say; religion is all absolute horseshit. However religious people seem to be the nicest so guess it doesn't matter.
04/11/2020, 16:59 - Noone: Whereas Muslims haven't accomplished anything in thousand years and yet they keep acting like they matter by blowing themselves and civilized people up
04/11/2020, 16:59 - Derren: <Media omitted>
04/11/2020, 16:59 - Wezz: Oh shit the filter fucked up
04/11/2020, 16:59 - Noone: No you massive faggot. I'm the nicest
04/11/2020, 17:00 - Kirky: Dont worry I've informed the agency, they're enroute to his house with a black van
04/11/2020, 17:00 - Noone: I BEAT THE FILTER YOU CAN'T STOP M-

__filter online__
__message suppressed due to possible offense__
04/11/2020, 17:00 - Paul: This is the worst thing said in this chat
04/11/2020, 17:00 - Noone: ___message suppressed due to potential for offense___
04/11/2020, 17:01 - Noone: He's wrong that all religions are horseshit. The white ones are doing fine, it's just the noble savages who we pretend matter who keep fucking things up
04/11/2020, 17:01 - Wezz: "They haven't accomplished anything in thousand (sic) years and they keep acting like they matter by blowing themselves... up" Jack Noone 2020
04/11/2020, 17:02 - Noone: Don't add that to my Wikipedia page
04/11/2020, 17:02 - Wezz: I remember my first beer
04/11/2020, 17:03 - Noone: I remember your first beer too. You kept leaning on us and telling us how you were "so drunk" and asking "hey guys can we talk about this!?"
04/11/2020, 17:04 - Mike: Beat me to it
04/11/2020, 17:04 - Mike: https://mobile.twitter.com/hannahhycho/status/1323851835199811587?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1323851835199811587%7Ctwgr%5Eshare_3&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffpost.com%2Fentry%2Fbernie-sanders-donald-trump-election-night-fears_n_5fa27d4ec5b6b35537e2684e
04/11/2020, 17:05 - Paul: Yeah saw that after trump speech in the morning. We didn't deserve Bernie
04/11/2020, 17:07 - Wezz: Good work Bernie you old genius.
04/11/2020, 17:07 - Lockers: Sorry so what were the issues with Bernie?
04/11/2020, 17:07 - Mike: Too old, we needed spry 70 something's
04/11/2020, 17:07 - Lockers: I wish I cba to follow us politics more, highly entertaining
04/11/2020, 17:08 - Mike: (he's 79)
04/11/2020, 17:08 - Wezz: However, can I just clarify again. I have no problem with mail in ballots, but they must arrive at the facility before deadline on election day.

Can't have random shipments turning up post deadline. Sort that out and it's all gravy.
04/11/2020, 17:09 - Mike: Has that happened? I think I saw mention of post in extensions due to postal issues out of voters control
04/11/2020, 17:09 - Wezz: If I've misunderstood and all the votes are in on time but they take days to count then that's fair doos.
04/11/2020, 17:09 - Mike: Could a missed it though if you got a link
04/11/2020, 17:10 - Derren: Stfu islamophobe, I'm reporting you to the NHS
04/11/2020, 17:10 - Derren: <Media omitted>
04/11/2020, 17:10 - Derren: I didn't realise UYU was an actual org
04/11/2020, 17:11 - Derren: I thought N0ne was just doing it to take the piss out of weebs
04/11/2020, 17:11 - Derren: üòÇ
04/11/2020, 17:11 - Kirky: Neither did I üòÇüòÇüòÇ
04/11/2020, 17:12 - Wezz: Mate, good luck, all my slaves are Muslim
04/11/2020, 17:12 - Wezz: *FRIENDS
04/11/2020, 17:13 - Kirky: Muslims are the slave owners in 2020 bro sorry
04/11/2020, 17:13 - Derren: You can't say that, you're a white man, fucking racist and sexist
04/11/2020, 17:13 - Kirky: Well, also all through history ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
04/11/2020, 17:13 - Kirky: See ? So defensive
04/11/2020, 17:13 - Derren: Paul would say the same
04/11/2020, 17:18 - Wezz: I saw same thing you mention, postal issues. Either way just voting start and cut off a week earlier for postal to avoid it imo
04/11/2020, 17:20 - Wezz: Soon we'll all be slaves to the Chinese. Already figured out my Chinese name
04/11/2020, 17:20 - Paul: Didn't misunderstand. Some states give a few days after the polls close for postal votes to arrive as long as they are postmarked from before the date. This is to give relief to postal workers in states that have issues with that. For example Pennsylvania
04/11/2020, 17:21 - Mike: Yeh and republicans trying to block these from being counted for obvious voter suppression type reasons
04/11/2020, 17:22 - Paul: Oh trump also said African states were shitholes can't believe I forgot that one
04/11/2020, 17:22 - Kirky: Dude Haiti IS a shithole
04/11/2020, 17:23 - Mike: Says man who's been to haiti
04/11/2020, 17:23 - Kirky: All those celebs suddenly jetted off to the 5 star resorts like "HEY LOOK HOW NICE IT IS" conveniently missing out the poverty and earthquake damage
04/11/2020, 17:23 - Paul: I'd say that's an appropriate opinion in a vacuum when you aren't an international diplomat
04/11/2020, 17:24 - Mike: That was hilarious
04/11/2020, 17:24 - Kirky: Yea I agree with that. Doesnt make the statement totally wrong though
04/11/2020, 17:24 - Paul: It's just with the many other things
04/11/2020, 17:24 - Paul: I don't think it's controversial to say he's racist is it?
04/11/2020, 17:25 - Mike: 70+ white man, pretty likely all things considered
04/11/2020, 17:26 - Kirky: Probably no more racist than Biden is in the privacy of his own head. But trumps not a politician, and I guess billionaire business men can generally do and say what they want
04/11/2020, 17:26 - Lockers: Alright Derek
04/11/2020, 17:28 - Paul: Dunno if I agree based on what they've said. But true that it's impossible to really know
04/11/2020, 17:29 - Paul: BNP supporter
04/11/2020, 17:30 - Mike: Biden has done some damaging stuff to black communities, intentional or not is hard to say
04/11/2020, 17:30 - Lockers: Glad we could export at least one ira ginger cunt
04/11/2020, 17:31 - Mike: But Trump is quite clearly, short of wearing a KKK hood, racist
04/11/2020, 17:31 - Kirky: That's kind of my point. Biden's probably less racist but hes had a life of politics learning to control what to say whereas trumps had an insanely privileged life of people bending over backwards to keep him happy due to his money so is unlikely to really have a good filter
04/11/2020, 17:34 - Paul: Great point I agree
04/11/2020, 17:34 - Mike: Glad we agree that systemic racism exists, @447850499652
04/11/2020, 17:35 - Lockers: Why do different sources quote different results btw?
04/11/2020, 17:35 - Mike: Institutional racism
04/11/2020, 17:36 - Paul: Some are more up to date than others and some call states earlier based on their projections but they all use the same data afaik
04/11/2020, 17:37 - Paul: Can we all just agree that despite wezz correcting himself and being more clear. We now all hate him for being antidemocratic and antisemitic
04/11/2020, 17:37 - Paul: Motion carries
04/11/2020, 17:38 - Kirky: Aye
04/11/2020, 17:39 - Paul: <Media omitted>
04/11/2020, 17:39 - Wezz: Mate voter suppression is 100% wrong, awful thing to do. I'm just trying to avoid the republican agenda that later votes = suspicious by using logistics.
04/11/2020, 17:39 - Paul: I'm gonna use this photo every election forever lol
04/11/2020, 17:40 - Paul: No too late. You hate Jews and it's obvious
04/11/2020, 17:41 - Wezz: Great pro-demo point Kirky, well done. I agree Biden is only a 6.29342 on the racism scale whereas trump is a 8.23381 hurr durr
04/11/2020, 17:45 - Wezz: Both are white, old, out of touch, men. One is a political puppet of 50 years, other is a megalomaniac celebrity who lacks a filter.

Does anyone actually like Biden? This is Trump vs no-Trump
04/11/2020, 17:46 - Wezz: I like the chaos a non-politician brings to the white house and mainstream media. If Biden comes in it'll be "we're recovering from all the damage Trump did in the last 4 years" on repeat while he's milking the political ties through corruption pent up over 50 years of failed campaigns.
04/11/2020, 17:47 - Wezz: And just because he tickles your democratic ginger balls you're gonna say "Yes please Mr Biden, can I have some more"
04/11/2020, 17:47 - Wezz: You make me sick
04/11/2020, 17:47 - Wezz: loooooool
04/11/2020, 17:47 - Paul: I was nodding along until here
04/11/2020, 17:47 - Paul: Lmao
04/11/2020, 17:49 - Mike: Don't look at me, I voted for kodos
04/11/2020, 17:49 - Mike: The solution to fixing the system isn't voting in some retard, but if it makes everyone happier feel free to shit on the chess board next time it feels unfair
04/11/2020, 17:50 - Paul: First step would be proportional representation. Then you can jump off the treadmill and actually work towards change. But the powers that be don't want that
04/11/2020, 17:52 - Wezz: Scrap the whole system, one round of Quiplash to decide the president. Audience = whole country.
04/11/2020, 17:54 - Lockers: Dude even I've won quiplash
04/11/2020, 17:54 - Wezz: But do you remember your first beer?
04/11/2020, 17:54 - Lockers: Abuse Paul... Become president
04/11/2020, 17:55 - Paul: Are those things functionally different in a system like this though? A lot of people parroting this position are also opposed to progressive reforms. It ends up just being a bit pretentious
04/11/2020, 17:56 - Paul: This whole enlightened centralism stuff. "Both sides have blood on their hands" but also against changing it
04/11/2020, 17:58 - Paul: Centrism? Centralism?
04/11/2020, 17:59 - Wezz: So you'll have to slow down because I'm stupid. But by progressive reform, you mean political/electoral reform? Because I'm totally down for those things. I also encourage participation in the shit system as the best interim approach.

But just fed up when people sneak a pro-Biden statement in with all the anti-Trump stuff. They're also completely unable to compliment Trump on anything positive he's done for fear of exploding. Bored of the political ideology that manifests from overconsumption of media agenda. Like to talk with people who share intricate opinion and are open to interpreting other perspectives.
04/11/2020, 18:00 - Paul: 100% wasn't saying you fit that position
04/11/2020, 18:00 - Paul: But your point aligned with their talking point
04/11/2020, 18:03 - Wezz: Yeah i'm not the standard pretentious 'enlightened centrist' type. But quite a lot of centre-lefts get through into that group, or the 'far-right' by the left. It seems, these days, passivity or a desire for nuance is seen as permissive, getting you brandished and ruled out from reasonable discussion with left-leaning individuals.
04/11/2020, 18:03 - Mike: I'm not sure I've seen much pro Biden, he is literally the anti trump vote though. Can't wait for 2024 and we have Trump Jr to listen to
04/11/2020, 18:07 - Wezz: Oh you see it, the media manifests a lot of it for sure.

It's really not hard to be moderate and reasonable vs Trump. You just have to come across as genuine too, and they just can't seem to get that bit right.
04/11/2020, 18:07 - Paul: But I think there's a difference between wanting nuance and a lot of the bad faith arguments used to imply they are both the same.
04/11/2020, 18:09 - Mike: I thought you meant this chat but see your point
04/11/2020, 18:09 - Mike: Depends on your source sure
04/11/2020, 18:09 - Kirky: @447561062944 WHO CARES WHEN LEAGUE NIGGA
04/11/2020, 18:09 - Paul: I find it hard to believe that a single moderate or centrist is pro trump. He's the antithesis of their political leaning. They are voting party instead of candidate which is fine. But then the message and talking points are insincere imo
04/11/2020, 18:10 - Paul: Yeah I've seen it a lot tbf
04/11/2020, 18:12 - Wezz: I agree, and that's far more common in the dichotomic world of fptp politics. Whereas in social studies you have a lovely gradient of correct answers and perspectives that can be discussed and appreciated. Then applied to complex topics without the foaming at the mouth desire for being 'right'.
04/11/2020, 18:12 - Wezz: COMING MY BLACK FRIEND
04/11/2020, 18:13 - Wezz: Again though, Trump is not FOR the political establishment. Biden IS.
04/11/2020, 18:14 - Wezz: IMO that's a reason why people like Trump over other candidates, regardless of core beliefs, but what do I know.
04/11/2020, 18:14 - Paul: Who is trump for?
04/11/2020, 18:14 - Wezz: Chaos, disorder, incompetence. Loads of things
04/11/2020, 18:16 - Paul: It's easy to nail down that Biden is an institutional politician and who he stands for. Whereas the easiest thing to do with trump is say that he's NOT that rather than saying what he is. That shouldn't appeal to moderates
04/11/2020, 18:16 - Paul: That's an extreme position
04/11/2020, 18:19 - Wezz: It's appealing across the board imo, modern politics is a popularity contest now more than ever. Easy to be fed up and lose trust in such an out-of-touch system. Esp when candidates are 70+.
04/11/2020, 18:20 - Paul: Right but steady eddie status quo moderate living down your road isn't of that opinion. Or if he is then his alignment has shifted with his disenfranchisement
04/11/2020, 18:20 - Wezz: There're some associated benefits that come from being not for the political system too, e.g. mocking nicknames of senators/candidates, soundbites, fresh unprofessional behaviours that come across as 'genuine'?
04/11/2020, 18:22 - Wezz: Totally, the disinterested searching for 'new' imo. Kinda shows with the uptake in voting too, obv an accumulation of reasons for that but I think it has something to do with it.
04/11/2020, 18:22 - Paul: Don't disagree I just wouldn't call them moderates then
04/11/2020, 18:22 - Wezz: What're his total votes like now compared to before?
04/11/2020, 18:23 - Paul: Way more highest turn out in history. Biden has the most votes ever. Trump 2nd most
04/11/2020, 18:24 - Wezz: I think their categorisation doesn't matter. It's representative in each group, as is voter turnout.
04/11/2020, 18:24 - Paul: But my whole point was about moderates and centrists
04/11/2020, 18:25 - Paul: Let's stop spamming everyone for a bit lol sorry guys
04/11/2020, 18:28 - Nathan: Anyone done any work today? Not stopped typing Jesus ü§£ü§£
04/11/2020, 18:29 - Wezz: Sorry, I guess my point is the 'not being for the political establishment' thing is attractive across the centre. The republicans/democrats are less likely to be affected. It's the undecided that do. But yeah, won't spam moreeeee
04/11/2020, 18:30 - Lockers: My thoughts too üòÇ get jobs ya bums
04/11/2020, 18:33 - Wezz: Are you even real? Thought everyone died of COVID up north?

04/11/2020, 22:07 - Paul: Jack Noone will say that's fake news
04/11/2020, 22:09 - Lockers: Anyone seen that so many of trumps tweets are getting flagged for being misleading?
04/11/2020, 22:10 - Paul: Yeah lol bit late
04/11/2020, 22:10 - Paul: Do that before everyone in the country votes next time please. Preferably 4 years earlier
04/11/2020, 22:10 - Lockers: Me or them hiding them?
04/11/2020, 22:10 - Lockers: Yeah
04/11/2020, 22:11 - Wezz: Nah Jack Noone will say, "I got hairy legs that turn blonde in the sun, and the kids used to get in the pool and straighten them with their hands. I learnt about kids jumping on my lap. I love kids jumping on my lap.‚Äù

04/11/2020, 22:19 - Paul: You must be actively trying to miss something if the postal votes are surprising you as an American
04/11/2020, 22:21 - Mike: Sleepy Joe is crossing the country dropping his votey Bois into naughty children's ballot boxes
04/11/2020, 22:21 - Mike: Anything else is a democrat paedophile conspiracy
04/11/2020, 22:24 - Mike: The accusation of mail fraud was months in advanced right? Pretty surprised at Trump's ability to predict that, I knows not a complete imbecile but this is a step up surely

Translation (16.14 CET +1):

All Danish mink must be killed.

This is what Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen (S) says at a press conference.

- The virus is mutated in mink, and the mutated virus has spread to humans.

Corona has been observed today on 207 mink farms.

- The mutated virus among mink may involve the risk that the upcoming vaccine will not work as it should, says the Prime Minister.

- We risk that the effect in the worst case will not occur. It could have devastating consequences for the pandemic of the entire world. A mutated virus is at risk of spreading to other countries.

According to SSI, several people from North Jutland are infected with mink, and the virus has changed so much that it can be a bomb during vaccine development.

According to the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration, 1,137 mink herds have been registered in Denmark, where there are approximately 12 million mink.

Feel like a crazy aunt posting weird shit to you, but this actually new.
04/11/2020, 23:01 - Kirky: omg
04/11/2020, 23:01 - Kirky: we're so fucked right?
04/11/2020, 23:01 - James: yes
04/11/2020, 23:04 - Wezz: Mutation defo = bad üòï even though was somewhat expected.

This along with evidence from Netherlands cases, is kinda confirming that.
04/11/2020, 23:19 - Mike: 1% of Denmark's GDP is based on Mink farming
04/11/2020, 23:19 - Mike: Pretty crazy

05/11/2020, 07:06 - Paul: Yes thanks I know that you think this you've said it 500 times
05/11/2020, 08:47 - Wezz: Standard democrat counting.

1, 2, skip a few. *200,000 POSTAL BALLOTS*
05/11/2020, 08:57 - Wezz: Also, the only reason Biden has all these votes is because of all the counting. If we did less counting he'd be screwed.
05/11/2020, 09:02 - Mike: I like to imagine this /Pol/yboy rubbing the Doritos dust on his chin believing he's cracked the case whilst swiveling in his chair
05/11/2020, 09:02 - Paul: Tangles up his headphone cable and screams at his mother who lost hope long ago
05/11/2020, 09:04 - Noone: Le convenient postal votes
Orange man bad
Defund the police

05/11/2020, 09:08 - Paul: Yes
05/11/2020, 09:08 - Noone: Why hasn't anyone won the election
05/11/2020, 09:09 - Paul: Everyone lost this election let's be honest
05/11/2020, 09:10 - Mike: <Media omitted>
05/11/2020, 09:11 - Paul: Is this an official announcement from the president?
05/11/2020, 09:11 - Noone: You can't believe a screenie of an email
05/11/2020, 09:11 - Paul: Who's Joe in this context? A reporterm
05/11/2020, 09:13 - Paul: <Media omitted>
05/11/2020, 09:13 - Mike: Seems confirmed, the hill is reporting it plus others. Apparently sent out to his donators, assuming the email is cut off and he actually asks for money or that'd be insane and surely illegal.
05/11/2020, 09:14 - Noone: Based
Set the sand people in their place
05/11/2020, 09:14 - Mike: Joe is just the dudes name in the email in this context
05/11/2020, 09:14 - Noone: Oh.
Lawd.
05/11/2020, 09:16 - Noone: <Media omitted>
05/11/2020, 09:18 - Wezz: This is _perfect_.
05/11/2020, 09:26 - Paul: This massive delay is gonna lead to so much confusion and misinformation
05/11/2020, 09:27 - James: Test Message: Is Whatsapp being shit?
05/11/2020, 09:28 - James: No, only when I try and send pictures apparently. Thanks Whatsapp
05/11/2020, 09:28 - Paul: Response message: no I don't think so
05/11/2020, 09:28 - James: <Media omitted>
05/11/2020, 09:30 - Paul: Presidential Candidate Kanye West has conceded defeat. Mr. West received ~60,000 votes1,¬†and alluded to a 2024 run2¬†via twitter. Nice of him to step down graciously after a well fought campaign
05/11/2020, 09:30 - Paul: Same can't find it on my phone
05/11/2020, 09:35 - Mike: How did the trump campaign not have access during counting? Shouldn't there be teams of multiple people per site?
05/11/2020, 09:41 - James: Maybe they meant the Trump teams don't have access to counting as a skill
05/11/2020, 10:13 - Paul: The counting is done publically and anyone can watch
05/11/2020, 10:54 - Mike: This would be an unfair advantage
05/11/2020, 10:54 - Mike: Lol as if we can trust the public
05/11/2020, 11:04 - Wezz: Nah Guilani said they had to stand x meters back meaning they couldn't verify outcomes.
05/11/2020, 11:04 - Wezz: Some shit like that
05/11/2020, 11:05 - Wezz: He had a presser yesterday. Was mostly bumhurt but that was his argument
05/11/2020, 11:14 - Paul: Guy is such a snake though
05/11/2020, 11:15 - James: He's probably been served a restraining order from a female vote counter or something
05/11/2020, 11:16 - Paul: This could also just be his dogshit vision
05/11/2020, 11:25 - Dayle: https://youtu.be/2dGtbBZgDDA

05/11/2020, 11:33 - Dayle: I hope somthat would be fucking poggers

05/11/2020, 13:20 - Mike: The reply comment is hilarious
05/11/2020, 13:21 - Kirky: the graph was actually "correct" but the count was wrong and was corrected right?
05/11/2020, 13:21 - Kirky: as opposed to just a fake graph
05/11/2020, 13:24 - Mike: Like the animation, no idea what the point was
05/11/2020, 13:38 - Paul: Yeah but it's going around a lot

05/11/2020, 13:38 - Paul: Well it was a data error not a wrong count

05/11/2020, 14:16 - Nathan: This is what they want you to do! Focus on America not on lockdown/brexit!
05/11/2020, 14:20 - Mike: I saw a Swedish minidoc that said their health minister blamed our lockdown for the spike in cases, as it forced people together before and after lockdown started and ended
05/11/2020, 14:21 - Mike: Could be bs, interesting point though as we enjoy our first lovely lockdown day
05/11/2020, 14:21 - Mike: Actually shouldn't say he blamed it, said it could be relevant
05/11/2020, 14:51 - Noone: Yes
05/11/2020, 14:51 - Noone: They corrected it by adding 100,000 votes
05/11/2020, 14:51 - Noone: I was aware of this btw lel

06/11/2020, 00:02 - Paul: Dude this speech is an absolute rambling mess lmfao
06/11/2020, 00:02 - Lockers: He's broken
06/11/2020, 00:02 - Lockers: fucking broken
06/11/2020, 00:03 - Mike: I caught a few minutes, reminded me of University and giving a presentation but not practicing before hand
06/11/2020, 00:04 - Paul: He was looking like he was reading
06/11/2020, 00:04 - Paul: If someone wrote that I just can't...
06/11/2020, 00:04 - Lockers: Yes! Exactly this
06/11/2020, 00:04 - Mike: Probably someone did, but he gave the ole Trump shine
06/11/2020, 00:04 - Lockers: *"Shit the lecturer is still looking at me expecting me to talk... keep talking"*
06/11/2020, 00:05 - Mike: Oh fuck they look expectant, I missed something, erm FRAUD
06/11/2020, 00:05 - Lockers: "err errr then arsenal just tried to walk it in"
06/11/2020, 00:07 - Paul: Less than 4k votes separating Georgia
06/11/2020, 00:08 - Lockers: Can't believe i watched that until the end
06/11/2020, 00:10 - Mike: That man got to the most powerful seat in the US on his ability to talk, how dare you
06/11/2020, 00:11 - Lockers: Unbelievable
06/11/2020, 00:12 - Mike: Tremendous wordsmanship, I'd say maybe the best words. You know his dad, also great words, he invented many you know. Some of the best ones, favourites to many, many good people. Great guy, great for America.
06/11/2020, 00:12 - Paul: Bigly
06/11/2020, 00:12 - Mike: Imagine him and Nigel Farage having a lock in, I'd chip in for that show
06/11/2020, 00:13 - Lockers: Big Nige was sucking off trump on the news this morning, calling fake news everywhere
06/11/2020, 00:15 - Mike: Surpised_pikachu.jif
06/11/2020, 00:17 - Mike: If Trump loses we won't see anymore Trump rally videos which is a shame
06/11/2020, 09:26 - Paul: So close to this being over
06/11/2020, 09:26 - Paul: At least the vote lol

06/11/2020, 09:28 - Paul: Great resource if anyone wants to see just how likely Biden is to take it. Realistically it should be a complete certainty now
06/11/2020, 09:28 - Lockers: https://youtu.be/WZWRhLW7Y8w

You watched this?
06/11/2020, 09:46 - Paul: Kept getting it in recommended. Yeah it's alarming. I think we're definitely on track for a coup. He's laying the foundation for his refusal to concede. No way it stays peaceful though. I'm not even sure it should be.
06/11/2020, 09:48 - Lockers: Really well explained too. Trump ain't giving up shit let's be honest
06/11/2020, 09:50 - Paul: I wanna see a montage of him and all his gang getting dragged off violently by the fbi like in wolf of wallstreet to the tune of Mrs Robinson
06/11/2020, 10:02 - Paul: He's taken the lead in Georgia!
06/11/2020, 10:03 - Paul: With less than 10k votes remaining
06/11/2020, 10:03 - Lockers: Biden has yeah?
06/11/2020, 10:04 - Paul: Yeah it's been trending his way insanely slowly for 2 days
06/11/2020, 10:04 - Lockers: Hooray
06/11/2020, 10:18 - Lockers: Why can‚Äôt trump go into the Whitehouse?

Because it‚Äôs for Biden
06/11/2020, 10:18 - Paul: Doesn't really work written does it
06/11/2020, 10:19 - Lockers: FOR BIDEN

06/11/2020, 10:42 - Paul: Jack's given up on subtlety lately lol
06/11/2020, 10:43 - Noone: Getting the last of my fun out before it becomes illegal to be straight

3 large news networks cut away from the President during an address before an election, does that say more about the president or the networks? Almost certainly depends on which of the seemingly 2 teams you decide you're on. Really shocking to see actually, wonder if that's a new first.
06/11/2020, 14:06 - Mike: Election results*
06/11/2020, 14:08 - Mike: Even Fox news not willing to reiterate claims of a fraudulent election, spooky times

07/11/2020, 18:14 - Wezz: scared at twitter censoring him tbh
07/11/2020, 18:14 - Wezz: let him look like a crazy fool
07/11/2020, 18:14 - Wezz: censor just makes his avid followers even more suspicious. fuck that shit
07/11/2020, 18:14 - Paul: They don't delete the tweets just flag them right?
07/11/2020, 18:14 - Lockers: Yeah
07/11/2020, 18:15 - Wezz: yeah hide em behind a click
07/11/2020, 18:15 - Wezz: just dont do it
07/11/2020, 18:15 - Paul: He should have been banned ages ago for inciting violence by their ToS
07/11/2020, 18:15 - Wezz: depends on the discretion of some corporation. slippery slope and he's gonna do it on tv anyway.
07/11/2020, 18:18 - Paul: They are only flagging his easily recognised fraudulent posts. I get your point. But a disclaimer isn't censorship
07/11/2020, 18:18 - Mike: Friends, romans, countrymen. We come together on Discord at 7pm to honour the birth and life of David Leopold Piper, I bid thee make your presence known and perchance regale us with your favourite Piper tale.
07/11/2020, 18:19 - Paul: Be there or be üî≤
07/11/2020, 18:20 - Wezz: Can agree to disagree, I just any censorship shit, especially when it's not directly inciting violence. Only adds to the deranged extremists. Felt the same about Alex Jones even though he's a massive loonybin
07/11/2020, 18:20 - Wezz: First is flags, next is shadow bans etc etc
07/11/2020, 18:20 - Wezz: YES I'M SO READY
07/11/2020, 18:21 - Paul: you know I'm massively anti censorship. I just think putting an asterisk is a good thing. It's not removing it. It's adding more information
07/11/2020, 18:21 - Wezz: I think it does nothing but amplify the opinion of the extremists, and loosen the grip on freedom of speech. That's my opinion :x
07/11/2020, 18:22 - Paul: Fuck your feelings libtard

10/11/2020, 14:45 - James: "I'm a white man and I am a bastion of ego and confidence. Citation needed to prove I am fragile. If you don't want to do the research, I will meet you outside in 10 minutes to show you how fragile I am."
10/11/2020, 14:45 - Wezz: Yeah don't post it cause password is there lolz
10/11/2020, 14:45 - Wezz: Even though gone to thousands of people obv don't wanna ruin it
10/11/2020, 14:46 - Paul: "Despite making up 13% of the population.."

Gets escorted out
10/11/2020, 14:46 - Paul: Gotta wear a fedora for the full effect for this one
10/11/2020, 14:46 - James: You've got a few weeks to grow a neckbeard before the call
10/11/2020, 14:47 - Wezz: Lool. US stats though right? I want straight up wrong/right for the better of humanity as a collective. That's my podium, one of harmony.
10/11/2020, 14:47 - Wezz: Ez
10/11/2020, 14:48 - Paul: Yeah it's just a meme of typical talking points lol
10/11/2020, 14:49 - Mike: As a physically fragile man I am appalled you would co-opt the term fragile to denigrate people who aren't physically fragile yet emotionally, are we all the same to you?
10/11/2020, 14:49 - Noone: "Is the NHS now open to making assumptions about people based on their skin colour?"
10/11/2020, 14:49 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
10/11/2020, 14:50 - Wezz: Who am I kidding, I can be whatever I want to be
10/11/2020, 14:50 - Mike: What do we do if Sam comes back preaching reparations?
10/11/2020, 14:50 - Paul: Tell them you identify as black and film it I'll grab some popcorn
10/11/2020, 14:50 - James: Pay him, to help him find his feet on his spiritual journey
10/11/2020, 14:57 - Wezz: It's actually disgusting. They pussyfoot their way around this shit regularly. Terrified of repercussions from either side. It's an hour long so I'll listen in prepared to make a statement.
10/11/2020, 15:01 - Mike: Have you never heard of the phrase fight fire with fire? It's how my dad died, he was a fireman.
10/11/2020, 15:17 - Kirky: Do you want me to send you the tshirt you got me for it?
10/11/2020, 15:17 - Kirky: I think itd go down well
10/11/2020, 15:38 - Paul: I dunno if disgusting is fair. Its like affirmative action. Whether or not you think it works (personally think it's actually detrimental) it comes from a good place inherently. Whether you think that's a good place from the businesses POV  (could argue it's entirely marketing), or from  general society. It's trying to right a wrong however futile or disorganised.
10/11/2020, 15:58 - Wezz: Yes please üôè
10/11/2020, 15:59 - Wezz: Had a good chuckle to this ty
10/11/2020, 16:03 - Wezz: Yeah my perspective was more disgust at the institution. Not the individuals who, as you say, are acting with good intention. However as a leading and teaching institution I expect some solid boundaries around controversial topics. Not appeasing the latest ideological cries. Advertising is a fine and valid reason for commercial entities, not for government funded ones imo
10/11/2020, 16:04 - Noone: Individuals doing it for a leg up career wise. I'd assume the worst of racists
10/11/2020, 16:06 - Wezz: I'll send an example of the bureaucratic vagueness it creates in regulation..
10/11/2020, 16:08 - Wezz: Has a stench of reparations in itself. I also see the merit in representing society/race in certain elected panels. However it's rarely justifiable. Especially when it comes at the expense of competence.
10/11/2020, 16:27 - Paul: I'm sure they'd see it as getting a level playing field rather than a leg up
10/11/2020, 16:29 - Paul: More to the point. Who doesn't look for advantages for a career push? One would be stupid to not take advantage of it
10/11/2020, 16:31 - Mike: Not old honest Jack, he once found out his good looks gave him an advantage so he became a retard to compensate
10/11/2020, 16:31 - Mike: God bless him
10/11/2020, 16:33 - Paul: He's done ya
10/11/2020, 16:34 - Noone: Hey! Wait....


Hey!
10/11/2020, 16:35 - Noone: Got a boner to watch True Detective season 1 again; anyone else seen it?
10/11/2020, 16:35 - James: It's because of that scene on the sofa right?
10/11/2020, 16:35 - James: Yeah, season one and two were both good, not seen any others if it continued
10/11/2020, 16:36 - Paul: Nice
10/11/2020, 16:36 - Noone: What
10/11/2020, 16:36 - Mike: Haven't, is it on Netflix?
10/11/2020, 16:37 - Paul: Didn't you watch it with us?
10/11/2020, 16:37 - Noone: Nah I got it dl'd though if you wanna watch it
10/11/2020, 16:37 - James: No, it was me, you, Alex and Chris before
10/11/2020, 16:39 - Paul: Ah shit yeah forgot about Chris
10/11/2020, 17:25 - Wezz: Yeah totally not blaming individuals. I'd defo do the same. Gotta take advantage of the social landscape. Just gutted I never got to own a slave y'know
10/11/2020, 22:22 - Dayle: Episode 2 of season 1 ex files is called deep throat my childhood is ruines
10/11/2020, 22:23 - Dayle: Also assassins creed val is good so far played for w hours
10/11/2020, 22:24 - Mike: The barn episode was too fucked up for TV, that the one?

11/11/2020, 08:54 - Noone: Tldw?
11/11/2020, 08:54 - Paul: Jack lockley posted that ages ago
11/11/2020, 08:55 - Paul: Politics is over Mike. The left won let's all just move on
11/11/2020, 08:56 - Noone: Yeah it's not gunna be fun again for another 4 years
11/11/2020, 08:58 - Mike: The video is super long for no reason, basics of it is if losing candidate does not concede they can for a vote from state delegates which is unrelated to popular vote or the electoral college. Currently there are more republican state delegates, if they had the balls to do it they could technically and legally appoint trump president from what I understand.
11/11/2020, 08:58 - Mike: Call*
11/11/2020, 08:59 - Noone: Yeah most TED talks are, hate watching most of them
11/11/2020, 08:59 - Noone: Big lols though. Doubt they'd risk civil war
11/11/2020, 09:00 - Mike: Civil war or prison is looking like trump's options atm
11/11/2020, 09:09 - Dayle: Anyone got a simba mattress?
11/11/2020, 09:18 - Wezz: No, tried an Emma mattress though. Pretty sick

11/11/2020, 09:44 - Derren: SIMBA
11/11/2020, 09:44 - Derren: There's some reviews on YouTube
11/11/2020, 09:45 - Wezz: My dad always said "you spend 3rd of your life in bed, rest of the time in your shoes. So invest appropriately"

He didn't know about the internet back then tbh
11/11/2020, 09:50 - Derren: You still sleep for 6 to 9h a day
11/11/2020, 09:51 - Derren: So get a good bed a good chair
11/11/2020, 09:51 - Derren: And you're laughing
11/11/2020, 09:51 - Wezz: Yeah was more referring to the shoes part. You've probably never heard of them mate, Mr WFH
11/11/2020, 09:52 - Derren: I'm on road rn fam

11/11/2020, 12:04 - Derren: You can see from his photo that he is uneven
11/11/2020, 12:05 - Derren: Dunno, was doing tests
11/11/2020, 12:05 - Derren: Will find out
11/11/2020, 12:05 - Qck: No she's dating Derren
11/11/2020, 12:05 - Paul: Yeah but that's a chronic illness not something you go to hospital for
11/11/2020, 12:06 - Paul: What happened
11/11/2020, 12:06 - Qck: I dunno let's get her in the group chat and find out
11/11/2020, 12:07 - Paul: No girls allowed
11/11/2020, 12:07 - Paul: Cooties
11/11/2020, 12:08 - Qck: Is that why you wear protection
11/11/2020, 12:08 - Paul: Yeah girls are icky
11/11/2020, 12:11 - Qck: That's why I always carry a dental dam
11/11/2020, 12:29 - Mike: Hope she's alright, can't imagine anything worse than being in hospital with your for company
11/11/2020, 12:29 - Mike: You*
11/11/2020, 13:27 - Derren: üò£

11/11/2020, 14:09 - Wezz: Hope she's alright üôè
11/11/2020, 15:03 - Dayle: What happened she didn't let you go on your smash again so you smashed her in
11/11/2020, 15:03 - Dayle: Rude ü§£ü§£ü§£

11/11/2020, 19:02 - Wezz: Anyone played the new League patch? It's absolutely atrocious. Worst UI decisions I've seen. And bugs absolutely everywhere. They have beta/test servers and this has been pushed to LIVE. Variable names and random shit. lol
11/11/2020, 19:03 - James: Your fault for still playing league
11/11/2020, 19:03 - Mike: <Media omitted>
11/11/2020, 19:03 - Wezz: Plus loads of client side settings bugged, some wiped, some in a weird half/half state. Every 'how not to patch' example in my first 1 game
11/11/2020, 19:04 - Wezz: it's laughable tbh, game is top 5 most popular game in the world and it's unbelievable
11/11/2020, 19:16 - Wezz: Funny cause their bug report forum was like, OK CALM DOWN GUYS. Use this structure for bug reports:
Server, Game type, Desc, Screenshot, Steps to reproduce, Expected result, Observed, Reproduction rate

Everyone like:
EVERY SERVER, EVERY GAME, core function x broken, Screened, JUST OPEN THE GAME, WORK, DOESNT WORK, 100%

Game is broked.
11/11/2020, 19:52 - Kirky: Classic Chinese shit

12/11/2020, 11:46 - Noone: Got nothing to hide, nothing to fear! Thought you'd understand that, comrade?
12/11/2020, 11:48 - Paul: Don't listen to this heretic he's trying to confuse your fragile minds with fancy words!!
12/11/2020, 11:56 - Wezz: I'm white and fragile
12/11/2020, 12:07 - Paul: Same man üòï
12/11/2020, 12:21 - Paul: https://www.gaytimes.co.uk/life/norway-bans-hate-speech-against-trans-and-bisexual-people/
12/11/2020, 12:21 - Paul: I actually despise anti free speech laws
12/11/2020, 12:21 - Paul: With a burning passion
12/11/2020, 12:22 - Paul: Smh expected better from Norway
12/11/2020, 12:31 - James: You also hate bi and trans people though, so this is really rage inducing for you I'd imagine
12/11/2020, 12:34 - Mike: Expansion of existing laws though, would be discriminatory to protect some and not others. I agree though, I'd probably err on the side of everyone say what you want except for inciting etc
12/11/2020, 12:34 - Mike: Double whammy
12/11/2020, 12:37 - Paul: Only because I'm a deeply closeted dolphinkin
12/11/2020, 12:40 - Paul: Fuck letting governments decide what is ok to say. Let society decide that organically

12/11/2020, 13:13 - Paul: This word has lost all meaning
12/11/2020, 13:14 - Noone: Has it?
12/11/2020, 13:14 - Paul: Yes it should be banned by the government
12/11/2020, 13:15 - Noone: Why make hate speech laws only apply to certain groups? Why not apply it to everyone?
12/11/2020, 13:16 - Paul: Well I think that is their goal eventually. If the group is big enough to make a stink about it
12/11/2020, 13:16 - Noone: Cut out the middle man. If you offend anyone then you're charged with a hate crime
12/11/2020, 13:17 - Qck: Welp, cancelling my trip to Norway, what's the point if I can't head to the fjords to scream my anti-trans rhetoric
12/11/2020, 13:17 - Noone: Then (((they))) will end up with a nicely Soy'd up populace
12/11/2020, 13:18 - Paul: It was like their main tourist attraction
12/11/2020, 13:18 - Noone: Do you guys remember concerts? Like standing among a bunch of people and witnessing a band play music for everyone
12/11/2020, 13:18 - Noone: Do you guys remember that? And nights out? Like you'd go to a club or a bar and maybe dance to some music with a bunch of other people
12/11/2020, 13:18 - Qck: Only when I access your memories from the cloud
12/11/2020, 13:18 - Paul: I remember Mike being kicked in the nuts at an artic monkeys concert if that counts?
12/11/2020, 13:18 - Noone: No? Yeah me neither
12/11/2020, 13:19 - Noone: If you want to join my new political party; we promise to genetically eradicate all Chinese people
12/11/2020, 13:20 - Wezz: Want me to come and play guitar in your room in my boxers?
12/11/2020, 13:20 - Noone: I unironically want to jam

12/11/2020, 13:30 - James: Don't care about you guys anymore, I'm in the urgent care market now, it's where the glitz and glam is
12/11/2020, 13:30 - Wezz: ...thought that was in cosmetic surgery?
12/11/2020, 13:31 - James: That's pretty urgent for some people *Looks at Paul*
12/11/2020, 13:31 - Wezz: I'd get so many dick enlargements. They'd be like, Sam you've had 8 surgeries.. surely it's big enough now.
12/11/2020, 13:31 - Noone: No no, it's in postage. Have you seen muscled up Kirky? He's like a chimapnzee, all lean and muscular
12/11/2020, 13:32 - Noone: Fucking horrifying
12/11/2020, 13:32 - Wezz: You joke but kirky's getting SWOLE
12/11/2020, 13:32 - Wezz: Last I 'eard he was drinking tuna from the can, brine and all.
12/11/2020, 13:32 - Noone: Oh, I'm not joking.
12/11/2020, 13:33 - Wezz: All these people purchasing home gyms... Kirky's lifting that shit half way across Ducklington
12/11/2020, 13:35 - James: Kirky carries his post van around the route to save petrol
12/11/2020, 13:40 - Noone: Good morning; In the news today:
Scientists are baffled by a seismic event recorded by seismographs stationed across the United Kingdom. Satellite imagery shows a portion of the Cotswalds shifting roughly 30 meters. Reports from those living in the area indicate the event was followed by a postal worker bursting from underneath a hill exclaiming "That'll cut my route down a bit."  More to follow.
12/11/2020, 13:41 - Noone: Kirky, did you lift and shift part of the countryside just to save time on your rounds?I'm asking the questions some are too afraid to.
12/11/2020, 13:41 - Kirky: Dug a tunnel through the cotswolds hills with a shovel to save 5 minutes a day
12/11/2020, 13:42 - Noone: Good god.
12/11/2020, 13:43 - Noone: Do you have any idea the kind of geographical damage that'll come about as a result of your actions? Flooding, mantle subsidence , disasters on a county wide scale
12/11/2020, 13:43 - Noone: Was it worth it?
12/11/2020, 13:48 - Paul: üßê
12/11/2020, 14:40 - Kirky: small price to pay for faster delivery of dildos and ice cream makers

13/11/2020, 07:53 - Wezz: Literally just YouTube skits badly segued
13/11/2020, 07:55 - Wezz: Has this been tried and tested? Cause I don't believe it. Someone whip up a vindaloo
13/11/2020, 07:57 - Paul: Mike once complained that mayonnaise was too spicy

13/11/2020, 09:39 - Wezz: Yes
13/11/2020, 09:51 - Noone: Yes
13/11/2020, 09:57 - Kirky: Yes
13/11/2020, 11:49 - Paul: We interupt this combo to bring you some breaking news. A large oversized and enraged postal worker has been spotted crashing through the streets of northern London causing widespread panic and chaos... we believe... wait... Ok I'm now being told that we are going live to the scene with senior correspondent Jack Noone for a live update on the situation. Jack, how's it looking?
13/11/2020, 12:38 - James: Paul, I am sorry to say that our colleague Mr. Noone has been engulfed by what we can only describe as a Postal-Apocalyptic catastrophe. At first the residents of northern London seemed eager to welcome this new force of efficiency, but their cheers soon turned to fear as he begin lifting large areas of neighbourhoods and business premises into what can be heard from the towering figure as "A quicker postie route". A force of locals have tried barricading heritage sites and areas of importance, include casinos and off-licenses, but the closure of these routes seemed to only anger this postal force even more. As we said at the top of the broadcast, senior correspondent Noone was consumed by the force while rehearsing his report, apparently highlighting this destruction incurred the wrath of... oh god, he's coming back. We need to go, back to the stUUDIOOOOOOoooooo.....
13/11/2020, 12:47 - Paul: James? Hmm sees like we've lost that signal. Apologies if any viewers found that distressing. We will try to get our feed back as soon as possible. Multiple sources are now confirming that the postal worker has been spotted heading south. We are urging viewers to remain inside or head further south where ever possible. For a lighter touch, have you ever found yourself with *too many* puppies? This story of lucky the super dog will leave you shocked! More on that in Mike's wholesome hour, after the break.
13/11/2020, 12:55 - Nathan: We interrupt your current viewing schedule with a breaking news story! The UK population have just been crowned the kings/queens of procrastination! Whats your thoughts on this shocking article Piper?
13/11/2020, 13:10 - Piper: You put da lime in da coconut ü••
13/11/2020, 13:16 - Wezz: Thanks Professor Piper, just what the country needs during this regal ceremony. Woah! And would you look at that, right on cue for MUM, or should I say @447943624891's Uplifiting Minute !
13/11/2020, 14:03 - Noone: Yes.. now? Ok.
I'm sorry to have to let you all know at home and in the studio that-
*Ambulance sirens heard blaring past studio
Let you all know that Mikey Wotton has been found dead, at the age of 29. It looks like-
It looks like he committed suicide.
13/11/2020, 14:04 - Noone: We'll let you know more as the scene unfolds but here in studio 6 things are a little chaotic so we'll pass it back to you
13/11/2020, 14:09 - Noone: _oh god he took the puppies with him... We need to clean these u-

13/11/2020, 14:22 - Piper: Now let me get this straight

13/11/2020, 14:30 - Noone: I'm imagining Piper has slid into frame along a trail of mike's brains and blood whilst doing this "bit" in blackface
13/11/2020, 14:30 - Noone: This is the end of local broadcast news. Mark my words.
13/11/2020, 15:31 - Wezz: His phonetics and poorly administered black face makes the whole scene a comedy.
13/11/2020, 15:32 - Wezz: Also Mike don't be a pussy, no one's allowed to take the easy way out. You guys best talk with me before you try that shit ‚ù§Ô∏è

13/11/2020, 15:54 - Mike: Probably you based solely on distance
13/11/2020, 15:55 - Paul: I'm pretty sure you could get to Germany quicker than you could to Nathan. It's like 2 hours max
13/11/2020, 15:56 - Paul: Hey Jack come up to my room and check out this new meme. Then whack. Fleshlight round the back of the head
13/11/2020, 15:58 - Noone: Cum and blood sprays up the wall- a silhouette of mike slides into frame with a long tube device in his hand
13/11/2020, 15:59 - Paul: I would go with the ghost of Drew that haunts this chat. How can you kill a ghost
13/11/2020, 16:00 - Noone: Can't kill a ghost. They exist in between the spirit realm and our physical plane
13/11/2020, 16:00 - Noone: You know that, stop playing stupid to be funny
13/11/2020, 16:00 - Paul: "It's a g...g...g... drew ghost"
13/11/2020, 16:01 - Paul: Title of Jack's autobiography????

13/11/2020, 16:27 - Wezz: You severely underestimate Tapan's strength. I think I could get Paul to do the deed himself with the right group ideology indoctrination üòé
13/11/2020, 16:32 - Paul: What a horrible thing to say I don't want to live anymore
13/11/2020, 16:32 - Wezz: Not yet Paul ffs

17/11/2020, 21:21 - Wezz: Some mega seedy brown bread with legit butter. 4 max though this loony needs to be locked up
17/11/2020, 21:28 - James: I regularly eat the 4 slices of toast, but never more
17/11/2020, 21:28 - James: Quoth the raven
17/11/2020, 21:28 - Wezz: NEVERFLOR-A

18/11/2020, 12:39 - Paul: Important question: earphones inside mask straps or outside?
18/11/2020, 12:46 - Derren: Who wears earphones anymore
18/11/2020, 13:04 - Nathan: Or at least ones with cables... wireless bruh
18/11/2020, 13:08 - Paul: The fuck is wrong with both of you
18/11/2020, 13:09 - Wezz: I usually have one in one out.
18/11/2020, 13:11 - Wezz: It's actually optimal imo. Cause can let it hang when drinking one side. But open to ideas.
18/11/2020, 13:14 - Paul: I try to prioritise it by what I'm most likely to take off first but I get it wrong every time
18/11/2020, 13:22 - James: I only use wireless now, get with the times old man
18/11/2020, 13:34 - Paul: Must be nice owning a billion dollar phone

18/11/2020, 13:36 - Derren: Any phone has bluetooth, you don't need an expensive one for that
18/11/2020, 13:37 - Paul: Right but people only use wireless earbuds since the new phones unless they were loud business men on trains with a phone clip on their belt
18/11/2020, 13:38 - Derren: Or in my case I bought a pair of wireless headphones with active noise cancelling because I was travelling everyday on the underground
18/11/2020, 13:38 - Derren: and also having earbuds in my ear gives me cancer
18/11/2020, 13:38 - Paul: I also travel on the underground every day
18/11/2020, 13:41 - Derren: I was using them for 4-5h a day 5x a week, why not buy something nice for myself
18/11/2020, 13:42 - Paul: Well you use your personality constantly and haven't upgraded that...
18/11/2020, 13:42 - Derren: There's no upgrade for perfection üëÄ
18/11/2020, 13:42 - Paul: Perfection + 1
18/11/2020, 13:43 - Derren: Infinity +1?
18/11/2020, 14:04 - Wezz: I'm now so used to removing it from the left side of my face to drink. That my de-masking is left side, then earphones+right side combo remove.

My life is 100x better.
18/11/2020, 14:04 - Wezz: I also have Bluetooth headphones, so all of this is just lies.
18/11/2020, 14:19 - James: I use wireless headphones for running so I don't garrotte someone at Mach speed
18/11/2020, 14:27 - Wezz: Keep getting these great work promos *NHS Discounts of our great staff <3* And it's just discount for LoveHoney (sextoys/dildos) and Wine boxes.

23/11/2020, 15:45 - Wezz: Is it a big job to compare inputs/leveling times across multiple accounts (that are same level) and just banning them.
23/11/2020, 15:47 - Wezz: I assume these multiboxed accounts level pretty synchronously..
23/11/2020, 15:53 - Mike: Yeh wouldn't be hard to stop
23/11/2020, 15:53 - Mike: Essentially similar tactics they use against bots I imagine
23/11/2020, 15:58 - Wezz: Well, I've botted a few games with custom scripts and got caught at varying time periods. Like, sometimes I get caught within 10 mins. And other times never. WoW never caught my little mining script I made, granted was back in 2010 or something.
23/11/2020, 15:59 - Wezz: Had web games ban me in 10 minutes. Think it's caught they were capturing div mouse position on button presses (!) despite me bypassing captcha and form submission deviations (button would move around randomly)
23/11/2020, 15:59 - Noone: Multibox scripts are X times more likely to get you banned, cheating whilst multiboxing is pretty rare
23/11/2020, 15:59 - Mike: All depends on their approach plus tolerance levels, I set up automatic macros on my gaming keyboard and left my character farming mobs all night a couple times
23/11/2020, 16:02 - Wezz: Would imagine coding some random switch/case variation with; time delay, pointer precision, spell use, area etc would help keep it under the radar. I mean, WoW farming is pretty repetitive in itself right?
23/11/2020, 16:03 - Noone: You can do everything with ingame macro system and a keyboard with macros. But it's very easy to detect
23/11/2020, 16:03 - Qck: See: wowglider
23/11/2020, 16:04 - Noone: When I played classic, to stop auto logout throwing me into a five hour login queue, I set up a random movement script. Bunch of people did the same but with no random delay on the inputs
23/11/2020, 16:04 - Noone: They got banned lel
23/11/2020, 16:07 - Wezz: Yeah, definitely have to add some random between input delays these days. Can get some pretty simple automation software (e.g. Automate) that allows for between key-press and between statement ms delay, make it a rand() and you're on your botting adventure..
23/11/2020, 16:08 - Wezz: When things are undetectable... straight to the courts ! Good ole Blizzard
23/11/2020, 16:08 - Paul: Just play 1 account like a normal person shesh
23/11/2020, 16:09 - Noone: Fuck that, games boring now without autism
23/11/2020, 16:09 - Paul: Surely you're already set for life then
23/11/2020, 16:10 - Noone: xDDDDDDDD
23/11/2020, 16:12 - Wezz: Also, surprised this hasn't seen a resurgence given crypto/anonymity.
23/11/2020, 16:14 - Qck: I'm sure there probably already is an alternative to glider now but fuuuck getting sued by Activision
23/11/2020, 16:15 - Qck: Is there still no word on classic being updated to TBC?
23/11/2020, 16:15 - Qck: As Shadowlands can quite frankly do one
23/11/2020, 19:25 - Wezz: https://v.redd.it/hm8vsp4d3y061

23/11/2020, 21:48 - Derren: üëÄ
23/11/2020, 22:17 - Dayle: There is more content in the shadow lands launch then there is at the end of bfa haha

24/11/2020, 08:33 - Paul: Now do a swanton bomb
24/11/2020, 08:50 - Wezz: Bygawwd, he's nearly broken in half!

24/11/2020, 09:50 - Noone: Ooooo it's one of the ones you get results at home?
24/11/2020, 09:50 - Noone: How do I get one?.
24/11/2020, 09:55 - James: Sell foot pics online
24/11/2020, 09:56 - Noone: James I'm not one of your Twitch boobie streamers alright?
24/11/2020, 09:56 - Noone: That said, I wrote your name on the "good boy donator" whiteboard and flashed one of my minge flaps for you, stop emailing me
24/11/2020, 10:02 - Wezz: Yeah 10mins to get results. Staff all being tested (finally). Hopefully have some new data on asymptomatics out soon.
24/11/2020, 10:02 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
24/11/2020, 10:03 - Wezz: Staff need to do them every 3 days and report results online. I think it's similar to the boots ¬£130 test you can get.
24/11/2020, 10:04 - Wezz: That's like, 1 foot pic
24/11/2020, 10:20 - Paul: Sharpie in pooper
24/11/2020, 10:21 - Paul: I think you're pregnant dude
24/11/2020, 10:22 - Wezz: You'd like that wouldn't you
24/11/2020, 13:16 - Paul: Mandatory vaccinations, thoughts?
24/11/2020, 13:17 - Noone: Mammary castigation, thoughts?
24/11/2020, 13:19 - Paul: I'm genuinely curious what people think. They've talked about it here
24/11/2020, 13:24 - Noone: I honestly don't know at this point
24/11/2020, 13:24 - Noone: We have mandatory vaccinations in young children for schools
24/11/2020, 13:28 - Paul: Yeah but those have years and years of longitudinal data... that's what slightly concerns me
24/11/2020, 13:29 - James: A parent can also just opt out of those. They're not mandatory, just assumed
24/11/2020, 13:41 - Mike: Make it opt out like organ donation, if you opt out of vaccinations are you put bottom of list for any transplants
24/11/2020, 13:42 - Mike: Or any medical care there is a list for
24/11/2020, 13:42 - Mike: You are*
24/11/2020, 13:42 - Mike: Also when you go to opt out a woman follows you with a bell shouting shame
24/11/2020, 13:43 - Mike: <Media omitted>
24/11/2020, 13:44 - Paul: I feel a bit uneasy taking a vaccine that's become so politicised and there is no data on long term effects. Generally I trust science but the hypochondriac in me is wary
24/11/2020, 13:44 - Kirky: Atleast 5
24/11/2020, 13:44 - Mike: Don't worry your pretty little head, the likely to die types will get it first I imagine. Obese, old, weak etc
24/11/2020, 13:45 - Mike: You'll just die of regular covid before then
24/11/2020, 13:45 - Paul: I feel better and pretty. Thanks Mike
24/11/2020, 13:48 - Derren: We sit in front of our computers all day playing games and watching porn, we are all weak
24/11/2020, 13:57 - Mike: Not all of us can be killed by a particularly spicy curry weakling
24/11/2020, 14:04 - Noone: Your strongest attribute is that your anus is impervious to spice
24/11/2020, 14:04 - Noone: Darren you'll be one of the first to go once I take over with my Proud Boy alliance
24/11/2020, 14:13 - Derren: <Media omitted>
24/11/2020, 14:39 - Wezz: Yeah, I understand the hesitance. When any drug is rushed through early phase research it makes me nervous. It helps when you see the other end; healthy people in life threatening conditions, underlying comorbidities killing people, and more recent long-COVID case reports.
24/11/2020, 14:41 - Wezz: And the fact you have global orgs collaborating on this in an unprecedented fashion. Roll out plan being elderly first (woo), then clinical/vulnerable etc.
24/11/2020, 14:43 - Piper: I dont tak vaccies becse I g ats
24/11/2020, 14:43 - Wezz: Despite all of this I believe it should be opt out. As Mike said. The area of discussion for me is how to fairly decentivise those who opt out. Organ donor is cool. How about requiring vaccination before travelling?
24/11/2020, 14:43 - Wezz: Oh wait, scrap everything I've said. I agree with Piper
24/11/2020, 14:43 - Noone: Go back to bed
24/11/2020, 14:46 - Wezz: Deal or No Deal Discord party Friday? Shots in discord.
24/11/2020, 15:58 - Dayle: Promoted one of my juniors today and its such an amazing feeling he was genuinely amazed so coool
24/11/2020, 15:59 - Noone: What did you promote him to
24/11/2020, 16:00 - Dayle: Not a junior
24/11/2020, 16:00 - Dayle: Haha
24/11/2020, 16:00 - Noone: That is the nature of promotion

24/11/2020, 17:44 - Wezz: Yeah man, sugar free gummy bears on Amazon.. just didn't think a little fruit foam bag would destroy me

25/11/2020, 00:19 - Derren: Gooks, haven't heard that one in a while
25/11/2020, 00:19 - Qck: Yeah whatever information Derren gleamed from his daily dumpert visits is worthless
25/11/2020, 00:19 - Wezz: Anime knowledge is like, inversely correlated with power.
25/11/2020, 00:20 - Wezz: Subliminally programming the next generations of Asia would change my mind.

25/11/2020, 10:27 - James: "Fragile..." Kirky reads, as he kicks the next package down the road
25/11/2020, 10:29 - Kirky: It actually is quite organised. All different roads are in each corner. Hit when you have this much shit theres no point making it super neat cause it just falls over when you drive
25/11/2020, 10:29 - Kirky: And each sack is a road too
25/11/2020, 10:29 - Kirky: I used to really like Christmas time before I started this job you know
25/11/2020, 10:30 - James: I can imagine, it's enough to drive someone to an anti-consumer communist mindset...
25/11/2020, 10:30 - James: (He's primed for indoctrination now Paul)
25/11/2020, 10:32 - Noone: Kirky isn't soy enough to fall for communism, he's started working out now

25/11/2020, 10:38 - James: Have you not seen the soviet chads with their enormous biceps?

25/11/2020, 12:19 - James: That's terrible, where is he playing these? What are they called specifically?
25/11/2020, 12:20 - Kirky: I would haunt you forever and ever
25/11/2020, 12:22 - Kirky: Imagine not playing games with the homies even if its shit
25/11/2020, 12:32 - Paul: I played 500 hours of dota2 with you guys just for the homies
25/11/2020, 12:32 - James: I played every shit battle royale game for the homies

26/11/2020, 12:01 - Noone: NOOOO
26/11/2020, 12:34 - Paul: Julia signed up for a free trial to some teaching website and forgot to cancel it. So they've taken a years membership (like 300 euros) when she literally used the website once. On their site it says you have a "right to withdraw" for 14 days after starting a contract. They are claiming that she should have cancelled within the 30 days and that the 14 days counted *within* that 30 day window (makes no sense). So they won't cancel it. Shall we just do charge back on PayPal? I'm pretty sure they can't do what they've done.
26/11/2020, 12:34 - James: Worst case scenario they will ban her account
26/11/2020, 12:35 - James: I don't think there is anything more they can do right?
26/11/2020, 12:35 - Mike: Might take a credit score hit too
26/11/2020, 12:35 - Mike: Worth it for 300 probably
26/11/2020, 12:35 - James: Yeah but that starts at max for being German anyway
26/11/2020, 12:36 - Paul: I'm pretty sure I read that companies can't do that free trial thing anymore
26/11/2020, 12:36 - Mike: I still see I everywhere, where'd you see that?
26/11/2020, 12:36 - Mike: It
26/11/2020, 12:36 - Paul: Think it's a new EU law
26/11/2020, 12:37 - Paul: But either way she used the site once
26/11/2020, 12:40 - Nathan: I did the same at uni for the FT premium so I could get some article, signed up used it once and forgot about it. When u got charged though they were fine about it and just refunded me
26/11/2020, 12:41 - Paul: Yeah we've already asked and they've refused
26/11/2020, 12:41 - Noone: Charge back the money
26/11/2020, 12:41 - Noone: Cancel the PayPal account after withdrawing any remaining funds
26/11/2020, 12:42 - Paul: And if the company then tries to sue us or some shit?
26/11/2020, 12:42 - James: Move to another country
26/11/2020, 12:42 - Paul: The one time you aren't serious...
26/11/2020, 12:43 - Noone: They won't
26/11/2020, 12:45 - Paul: Ok the law is only about misleading free trials
26/11/2020, 12:46 - James: I think if it didn't explicitly tell you it would start automatically, then you can chargeback
26/11/2020, 12:47 - Nathan: 30 months of WoW subscription that as well üò≠
26/11/2020, 12:47 - Paul: I imagine it probably did
26/11/2020, 12:47 - Paul: She just forgot about it
26/11/2020, 12:48 - James: Have you looked up whether other people have chargebacked the same company online?
26/11/2020, 12:55 - Paul: Doesn't seem like it
26/11/2020, 12:57 - Nathan: How can you have a 14 day refund policy on a free trial? That doesn't make sense at that point surely
26/11/2020, 12:58 - Noone: Just charge the money back
26/11/2020, 13:01 - Paul: That's what I said. They've argued that the contract began when making the account and this was clearly laid out to us. They've offered a 20% discount as a token of "good will"
26/11/2020, 13:01 - Paul: Dude I don't honestly think it's that simple tbh
26/11/2020, 13:01 - Paul: It's easy to say that when it's not you
26/11/2020, 13:05 - Noone: I've done it
26/11/2020, 13:08 - Wezz: This. PayPal charge back
26/11/2020, 13:11 - Paul: Even after they've explicitly said no to cancelling it and stated why?
26/11/2020, 13:11 - Wezz: You also should just email your situation to them, referencing their T&C and stating 14 days. Reference some ombudsman bs. Get their response in writing.

Next email. Say you will get your credit card company to cancel.
26/11/2020, 13:12 - Wezz: Have they said in writing "no"?
26/11/2020, 13:12 - Paul: Yes
26/11/2020, 13:12 - Wezz: Kk definitely go PayPal route then. Change back and then leave it to PayPal to sort it with vendor. If they don't, close your PayPal account.
26/11/2020, 13:13 - Paul: They've already taken the money from PayPal does it still work?
26/11/2020, 13:13 - Noone: Yep
26/11/2020, 13:13 - Wezz: Yes, go to resolution centre in PayPal.
26/11/2020, 13:13 - Wezz: Also if was credit card can contact credit card vendor direct and skip PayPal.
26/11/2020, 13:14 - Wezz: Fuck that company though

28/11/2020, 23:26 - Wezz: I love a good freak show. But this is weigh in has been cringeworthy throughout. Was hoping Paul would at least bring some YouTube drama to the mic. Failed hard.
28/11/2020, 23:27 - Wezz: Cause the host was absolute garbage, plus mic feedback throughout. One pullout then replacement tested COVID+. Lol

28/11/2020, 23:29 - Paul: They'll be gased in the first minute lol

28/11/2020, 23:30 - Wezz: Can't wait
28/11/2020, 23:30 - Paul: Was hoping for "I'll fuck you til you love me faggot"

07/12/2020, 16:34 - Qck: Yeah, most people would just renounce being a paedo but I'm glad you don't want us to get it twisted you sick fuck
07/12/2020, 17:30 - Wezz: You make me sick Lockers.

_Literally_
07/12/2020, 17:31 - Noone: You said it's getting worse Lockers? Do you live by yourself or are you a normie with a gf?
07/12/2020, 17:32 - Noone: Dont want my lesser self suffering alone
07/12/2020, 17:32 - Wezz: Don't listen to him, he wants to rob you while you're WEAK
07/12/2020, 17:39 - Lockers: Yeah it's not great but I've felt worse. Yes I live by myself
07/12/2020, 17:39 - Lockers: No matter how much it gets me I could still take him
07/12/2020, 17:40 - Qck: Sounds like we won't find out until we have a Jack off
07/12/2020, 17:45 - Kirky: Jack off on cam at christmas parry confirmed
07/12/2020, 17:52 - Wezz: Can't wait for our live communal jack off. Been holding in my excitement for ages.
07/12/2020, 17:54 - Wezz: Great UFC card on after our Christmas jack off night too.
07/12/2020, 18:04 - Paul: I only show up if it's Tyson or one of the Paul brothers these days
07/12/2020, 20:59 - Dayle: anyone gaming tonight?
07/12/2020, 21:05 - Mike: DND BOYEE
07/12/2020, 21:05 - Derren: Gay
07/12/2020, 21:06 - Qck: Say that to my half goblin you faggot
07/12/2020, 21:06 - Mike: Half Gnome, half Goblin.  A gnoblin, if you will.
08/12/2020, 08:08 - Paul: Btw been reading some cyberpunk reviews. I'd recommend people wait until the game has been patched a few times basically everyone is saying it's buggy as hell atm
08/12/2020, 08:59 - Mike: https://i.redd.it/tv3ow4h6qu361.jpg
08/12/2020, 09:00 - James: If that's real, that's in the thousands right?
08/12/2020, 09:00 - Paul: Csgo streamers occasionally get 20k donations
08/12/2020, 09:00 - James: Not sure why people are surprised, it was never going to be a massive open world game without issues
08/12/2020, 09:00 - Mike: 3090s going for like 1200?
08/12/2020, 09:00 - James: Yeah, in your dreams Paul
08/12/2020, 09:02 - Mike: https://i.redd.it/t29x65bw8u361.png
08/12/2020, 09:03 - Paul: Isn't this just the wrong use of that meme
08/12/2020, 09:05 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
08/12/2020, 09:07 - Mike: We need another video if someone videoing you
08/12/2020, 09:08 - Lockers: It's all in reaction to my positive test m8
08/12/2020, 09:09 - Paul: /r/killthecameraman
08/12/2020, 09:24 - Noone: Christ how pathetic
08/12/2020, 09:27 - Noone: Lol don't give game reviews any notice. Most of them have 10 hours in the game. Viddy game journos are notorious for getting things wrong
08/12/2020, 09:28 - Paul: Literally everyone is saying it's super buggy with T poses and shit
08/12/2020, 09:28 - Noone: Ye reports of bugs yet the game has 9/10. One even read "it's not perfect......" And then gave it 10/10
08/12/2020, 09:29 - Paul: Right so ignore the score and listen to what they are saying
08/12/2020, 09:29 - Paul: The scores are bought
08/12/2020, 09:33 - Mike: As long as nothing game breaking is posted, T poses can actually be pretty funny
08/12/2020, 09:34 - Paul: Plenty of game breaking stuff too
08/12/2020, 09:34 - Paul: Enemy AI bugging out completely. Enemies seeing you through walls. Dead bodies triggering combat. Elevators not working to continue to next part of mission. Etc etc
08/12/2020, 09:35 - James: I mean, I was never going to buy it full price, too much other shit to play, but if I'm playing a serious game then it will definitely taint my experience if an emotional cutscene has half the people glitching out
08/12/2020, 09:36 - Paul: A common review consensus is that they are jealous of people who get to play it polished in 6 months
08/12/2020, 09:36 - James: I don't think there is any doubt it will be amazing, but from the sounds of it, it's basically early access without the label
08/12/2020, 09:37 - James: and I don't blame them, I think they would have been lynched if they delayed again until after Christmas
08/12/2020, 09:37 - Noone: Which means nobody in the world should buy it
08/12/2020, 09:38 - Mike: Jungle bells,
Crunch time hails,
No one's going home
08/12/2020, 09:39 - Noone: I know Bethesda was forgiven for the longest time for their bugs because their games were so rich with detail. It was all throughout the new Vegas reviews and fallout 4 ones too. Then they released fallout 76 and I wonder if it was just because they got complacent...
08/12/2020, 09:41 - Paul: A bug here and there is fine and can be funny. I've had a couple with my witcher3 run. But if it's really prominent then it just detracts from the immersion. And this game is so much about the atmosphere. If it's a really intense gang scene and Jimbo is in the corner glitching through the wall for the 4th time it's gonna just be shit
08/12/2020, 09:41 - Noone: If Jimbo Jones is in this game I'll buy seven copies
08/12/2020, 09:42 - James: and I think with Bethesda games it was part of their charm for a while
08/12/2020, 09:42 - James: I remember a stand up comedian saying about things you find funny and cute at the start of a relationship become incredibly annoying if they don't change after years, and that's what happened with Bethesda
08/12/2020, 09:43 - Paul: I'm gonna get it on ps5 anyway so I need to wait 500 years for that to be in stock
08/12/2020, 09:44 - James: Like, people applauded Skyrim for being so atmospheric and ahead of it's time, and then Fallout 4 came out, and it was the same shit, and then again with 76, and every version of Skyrim since
08/12/2020, 09:44 - James: And they're no longer ahead of the game, they just seem lazy
08/12/2020, 09:45 - Paul: Please don't be shit TES6 üôèüèª
08/12/2020, 09:45 - James: I'm expecting Skyrim with better boob physics
08/12/2020, 09:45 - Paul: Yes perfect!!!!
08/12/2020, 09:46 - Paul: Honestly just Skyrim where the town's people acknowledge when you're better than them
08/12/2020, 09:46 - James: You'll be talking to Bertha the Bosomous, and she'll be jiggling all over the place and bugging out, superpositioned nipples and people will give it 9/10
08/12/2020, 09:46 - Paul: Giving me lip in full daedric?
08/12/2020, 09:49 - Noone: <Media omitted>
08/12/2020, 09:52 - James: "But guyes, don't you know they left some bugs in on purpose?! huehuehue"
08/12/2020, 10:07 - Dayle: he getting some long d

08/12/2020, 12:27 - Lockers: Any idea why?
08/12/2020, 12:34 - Wezz: No idea - I assume COVID vaccine news backdrop?
08/12/2020, 12:36 - Lockers: Don't think I can answer that question m8
08/12/2020, 12:37 - Wezz: You should be stuck at home mate. Stick the news on lemme know if you can see me with my lunch
08/12/2020, 12:38 - Lockers: I am stuck at home... Working
08/12/2020, 12:40 - Wezz: Thank you Lockers üôè

08/12/2020, 12:55 - Kirky: Shouldve given bumrs a live shoutout I'm disappointed
08/12/2020, 13:00 - Tristan: You coulda made it into a news blooper reel!!
08/12/2020, 13:03 - Dayle: <Media omitted>
08/12/2020, 13:03 - Dayle: that is an image of their twitter btw so im not just fucking taking confidential pics
08/12/2020, 13:06 - Lockers: Turns out Boris was in the hospital m8
08/12/2020, 13:06 - Lockers: What did you do then?
08/12/2020, 13:09 - Wezz: Ooo, no shit. Before they had armed guards and stuff. None of that this time. Ty for info
08/12/2020, 13:11 - Dayle: architected the system üòÇ
08/12/2020, 13:13 - Lockers: Yeah I can read the words that you wrote, but are you saying that you built the whole thing? Like lamens terms what does "architected the system" mean
08/12/2020, 13:14 - James: Like a technical designer, planner, and implementation overseer from my experience
08/12/2020, 13:15 - Dayle: Sorry currently jump starting my missus car so can't type alot of waffle right now
08/12/2020, 13:15 - Dayle: But James summed it up
08/12/2020, 13:16 - Lockers: Oh right fair, how many in the team then?
08/12/2020, 13:18 - Qck: Yeah but with new vegas, Bethesda literally shipped a game that was unfinished by their developers and then disbanded that development team because they didn't hit their metacritic incentive
08/12/2020, 13:18 - Noone: "sir this is a restricted area, please leave"
08/12/2020, 13:19 - Qck: Seems like CD projekt red  just had a stupid crunch timeline where they expected the game to be released multiple times
08/12/2020, 13:19 - James: "Can I interest you in a COVID vaccine scheduling solution?" "Sir, this is a Wendy's"
08/12/2020, 13:20 - Qck: I don't think anyone is expecting cyberpunk to get less than 9s even if it was literally a 20 hour cutscene of Keanu Reeves sitting on a bench
08/12/2020, 13:20 - James: The only people with that is some devs will suffer, and they're not real people anyway
08/12/2020, 13:20 - Noone: "ah, well, Wendy's vaccines get here you'll all be saved!"
08/12/2020, 13:21 - Noone: He drew boxes in paint and then the Devs did the real work and actually built the thing
08/12/2020, 13:21 - James: Why don't we load up tranq guns with the vaccine and let Noone live out his mass shooting fantasy?
08/12/2020, 13:21 - Lockers: Uh oh what have you done
08/12/2020, 13:21 - Dayle: pretty much :|
08/12/2020, 13:23 - Dayle: well at least I know now I cant celebrate a good thing with jack in the room haha should have known!
08/12/2020, 13:24 - James: Nah, we're proud of you man!
08/12/2020, 13:25 - Qck: Yeah don't listen to Jack, he hasn't even found the shape tool in paint yet
08/12/2020, 13:25 - Lockers: Turns out I'm the nice Jack after all, good work man. Although could have got involved a bit sooner so I could have had it üôÑ
08/12/2020, 13:27 - Dayle: Also just for the question now i have stopped fixing the missus car fucking thing,

I am the cloud architect & systems designer of the infrastructure,  DevOps architect for the continuous integration and zero downtime deployments on a geographical scale across the UK also yeah did some dev work, Also application architecture for the logging and monitoring solutions etc etc etc

But yeah thanks lads really great moment for me - all the stress and hard work over the last months has really paid off
08/12/2020, 13:28 - Qck: Sir, this is a Wendy's
08/12/2020, 13:28 - Dayle: I am sorry i will make like tree and leaf
08/12/2020, 13:28 - Noone: Does the shape tool do all that?
08/12/2020, 13:29 - James: No, you need to use the spray can one too

08/12/2020, 14:00 - Dayle: haha with my little vac card.
08/12/2020, 14:00 - James: Paul's not allowed the jab, he's vac banned
08/12/2020, 14:01 - Dayle: Anychance we can upvote this?

16/12/2020, 09:22 - Paul: And apparently it can understand every language lol
16/12/2020, 09:23 - Lockers: Can it detect sarcasm?

16/12/2020, 09:23 - Lockers: too
16/12/2020, 09:23 - Paul: There's just no way this works like they are claiming unless it's far more advanced than even Google's AI
16/12/2020, 09:24 - Mike: Maybe it's just based on tone?
16/12/2020, 09:24 - Derren: Paul is expert on ai
16/12/2020, 09:26 - Paul: <Media omitted>
16/12/2020, 09:28 - Paul: I wish üòï
16/12/2020, 09:36 - James: Well, it depends on their definition of context. It might just be able to put a level against a suspected activity (however they define activity, maybe a certain amount of incidents within a certain time) and getting enough flags within a time period would incur a ban. It's not impossible, but they aren't going to release something that bans all their players.
16/12/2020, 09:37 - Derren: @447561062944 https://youtu.be/hjMqMPKa9Mk  do this one night
16/12/2020, 09:38 - Paul: They've already shown some examples of how it's judging toxicity and it's super rudimentary. Seems to basically flag a sentence as toxic if it has a swear word. "Is that guy fucking lagging for you?" In their own blog scored a 78% toxicity lol
16/12/2020, 09:39 - Paul: So it's probably just a voice to text interpreter and does nothing to do with actual context.
16/12/2020, 09:40 - James: Yeah, but what I mean is they might add a flag against that for 78, and not do anything about it until that person has flagged a certain amount of times/over certain scores
16/12/2020, 09:40 - Paul: None of that requires AI except the interpreter
16/12/2020, 09:40 - James: I'm confused to your point here, what are you trying to say?
16/12/2020, 09:41 - Paul: That they were implying their AI could understand interpreted context
16/12/2020, 09:42 - Paul: When in reality it's just an AI that interprets it to text and then it's just normal ban algorithm
16/12/2020, 09:43 - James: It never said it could understand context, purely that it uses context. As I said above it could use data context, for example if someone gets a high score, the next few people might get lower scores to compensate for them being provoked.
16/12/2020, 09:43 - James: I'm not saying this is how it works, but saying it can't work because AI can't understand sarcasm is oversimplifying it
16/12/2020, 09:46 - Paul: As you said before I guess it depends on how they are defining context here.
16/12/2020, 09:47 - Paul: They are fairly notorious for making shitty decisions so I'm not super confident though. I imagine they are trying to oversell it
16/12/2020, 09:48 - Paul: Australians saying cunt every other word... hopefully it's got a pretty good data context algorithm
16/12/2020, 09:48 - James: Australia never stood a chance
16/12/2020, 10:24 - Dayle: Any one using helmcharts, TF or who just want to check out their code found this little gem - https://snyk.io/
16/12/2020, 10:25 - Dayle: they have a nice CLI to use
16/12/2020, 12:31 - Wezz: I mean. They're example of context was playing loud music for 10 minutes. Something that can be measured pretty objectively.

You just ate their bs and interpreted it as some fantastical thing.
16/12/2020, 12:32 - Wezz: Their* holy fuck. Everything I said is invalidated
16/12/2020, 12:33 - Wezz: The irony of misinterpreting context by not considering context is pretty cool.
16/12/2020, 12:38 - Paul: Right but for the fringe cases it becomes far more controversial. You get a lot of griefers and throwers in cs. Especially in the free game mode. Probably close to 50% of the games has someone throwing after an argument or lost eco round. The context of the scenario is rarely gonna be as clear cut as that. So it still has to interpret context on some level surely? Or at least attempt to. Unless context literally just means repeat offenses. In which case they would be deliberately ignoring actual game context.
16/12/2020, 12:39 - Paul: So then what's the actual "AI" element here? You don't need machine learning to find repeat offenders.
16/12/2020, 12:39 - Paul: It's purely just speech to text AI
16/12/2020, 12:41 - James: Well, machine learning is just about giving a data set and asking for a result. A lot of the time they don't know how it's going to get that result. They could say that they want to reduce the amount of people that are reported, and a machine learning algorithm could look at the causes before a report and voice patterns and specific phrases
16/12/2020, 12:41 - James: Again, I'm not saying that is how it's going to work
16/12/2020, 12:42 - James: but I think you're ruling out a lot of AI applications
16/12/2020, 12:43 - James: It's the same reason Google don't know how their Youtube algorithm works, they just ask for increased interaction, or people to watch 85% of the the videos they click etc
16/12/2020, 12:43 - James: The machine learning just keeps changing things until it hits it's target
16/12/2020, 12:43 - Paul: Yeah I know how machine learning works I just don't buy the marketing of it here
16/12/2020, 12:44 - Paul: Far too many variables unless they are running it on thousands of super computers
16/12/2020, 12:45 - James: You've lost me again, your argument keeps coming back to you don't believe they're using AI, but that's not the conversation. It would cost much more to have people trawling through the data to make it look like AI.
16/12/2020, 12:45 - Paul: I don't doubt they are using AI. Just that the scope if it's application isn't truthful
16/12/2020, 12:46 - James: "if it's"? Alright, go home Paul HAHAHAHA
16/12/2020, 12:46 - Paul: Or won't work as they intend
16/12/2020, 12:46 - Paul: Sorry ‚òπÔ∏è
16/12/2020, 12:48 - Wezz: Paul, I feel your definition of context is leaning to linguistic. Whereas it's likely to be more objective, simpler contextual evidence. E.g. ear rape, mic spam.

Then in another breath they're elaborating the overall objective and potential future developments (as with most AI/ML, and as James is well describing).
16/12/2020, 12:49 - Paul: Yeah I get that. I just don't think that works beyond really simple cases. Frankly *because* they have to ignore linguistic/situational context
16/12/2020, 12:50 - Paul: Happy to be proven wrong I'm just sceptical
16/12/2020, 12:51 - Paul: Faceit often oversell and underdeliver... There's my extra context bias that us AI couldn't factor in
16/12/2020, 12:52 - Paul: Also don't [name comma] me bitch!
16/12/2020, 12:53 - Paul: Save that for the intervention
16/12/2020, 12:53 - James: Paul, I think you're overreacting
16/12/2020, 12:53 - Paul: FUCK THIS GUY
16/12/2020, 13:05 - Wezz: Loool.
16/12/2020, 13:49 - Qck: If this was a reddit thread, Paul would be sitting at negative karma for all of his comments
16/12/2020, 13:52 - Wezz: It doesn't help there's a huge mystique 'buzzword' feel to ML. Start with a simple objective and known variables. Then work on the error type 1 and 2s, often by comparing to user evaluation or existing objective data. Then you add to the decision tree. Until eventually you no longer understand iterations, lose track of reality and robots take control.
16/12/2020, 13:54 - James: I, for one, welcome our new robot overlords

18/12/2020, 11:17 - Noone: GW2 better anyway
18/12/2020, 11:18 - Wezz: Can't do shots between WoW games, die of old age
18/12/2020, 11:18 - Paul: Meh... tried to like it. Just always felt clunky
18/12/2020, 11:18 - Noone: <Media omitted>
18/12/2020, 11:18 - Paul: Can do shots between PvP games or between raid boss fights
18/12/2020, 11:22 - Wezz: I don't know how people enjoy WoW's combat system. It's like typing out the same sentence on your keyboard until the big boss dies. Occasionally having to do a WarioWare command that appears on the screen from a plugin
18/12/2020, 11:23 - Wezz: Do any of the new MMORPGs reward reactions?
18/12/2020, 11:24 - Paul: You'd have to experience the hype of everything coming together with your team finally. Everyone hitting their movement and timings properly. Avoiding that shitty mob that always wipes you. It's really one of the best gaming feelings when you finally down a hard-core boss together tbh
18/12/2020, 11:29 - Wezz: Yeah I guess I never did the community thing properly to appreciate it. Just did my spell rotations until things died. Watched a load of old 3v3 PvP that was entertaining during glory days
18/12/2020, 11:30 - Lockers: Yeah but where are the flickshots or the clutches though
18/12/2020, 11:31 - Paul: You can clutch raid bosses sometimes lol
18/12/2020, 11:32 - James: Honestly, I do miss the raids when everything went to shit at 2% and one tank would somehow go godlike and finish the boss on their own, was such a cool experience
18/12/2020, 11:32 - Paul: James gets it

21/12/2020, 07:56 - Paul: Derren/Kirky What happens with hbox I see him coming like 9th in these tournaments and no one acting like it's a big deal. Wasn't he like the best?
21/12/2020, 07:57 - Paul: Happened*
21/12/2020, 08:26 - Derren: Since covid and no tourny for the first half of the year he became a reaction YouTuber and streamer playing ultimate more cos it gets more viewers, didn't want to play the old net play cos it wasn't amazing and again wasn't playing melee as much meanwhile everybody else was grinding like mad
21/12/2020, 08:27 - Paul: Ah right. Damn it's sad that ultimate gets more viewers
21/12/2020, 08:27 - Derren: Then slippi came out and it feels very close to playing irl on crt, people were practising more and they were doing tournys etc but he still was doing his streaming shit and got shit on in any tourny he entered
21/12/2020, 08:28 - Derren: He says now also that he can't play online as well as he can irl blah blah excuses
21/12/2020, 08:28 - Paul: Do you think he'll return as one of the best when LAN starts again?
21/12/2020, 08:28 - Derren: Plus he never plays friendly matches with anybody
21/12/2020, 08:28 - Derren: I dunno man, people been getting really good since slippi came out
21/12/2020, 08:29 - Derren: It's unlimited free practise basically the same as being on lan and you can play anybody on the same continent as you basically
21/12/2020, 08:30 - Derren: Will have to wait until next year to see but ultimate is making him really slow

05/01/2021, 12:07 - Mike: 2120, January 3rd, AIL. I wake from my bed and stand before the Tier clock, wondering what Tier I will be in today. Bad luck, the clock strikes Tier 165. I will not be allowed to leave 2nd floor lest my personally assigned BorisBot beats me into oblivion. I will go back to sleep and try again tomorrow, hoping for a sub-50 tier so that I can go to the super market.
05/01/2021, 12:29 - Paul: Fruitshoot from Robinson's. New thinking. New drinking.
05/01/2021, 14:27 - Mike: Last chance for the shirt, gonna order today for anyone whos forgotten: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NQNnhbouAp5aHiEVoNf9wk7fmXvOeyWjobZXIXsZrCU/edit?usp=sharing

05/01/2021, 21:18 - Paul: Nice
05/01/2021, 21:18 - Lockers: I remember when Sally from the canteen posted that on Facebook
05/01/2021, 21:19 - Paul: Wezz invented Facebook
05/01/2021, 21:19 - Wezz: Yeah my Mum actually shared it with me... all time low sharing that
05/01/2021, 21:20 - Paul: No wait didn't you steal a joke from this chat, send it to a guy, then remove him from your friends? Good times
05/01/2021, 21:21 - Paul: I think of that poor man often
05/01/2021, 21:22 - Wezz: Stole it from you haha, genuinely can't remember who the recipient was... goes to show the drivel on my Facebook.

Really enjoyed this piece on the street vendors I used to buy hot dogs from EVERY WEEKEND at 4am when leaving clubs
05/01/2021, 21:24 - Wezz: Turns out it's a black market thing... and Mitcho's on the case. Too funny.
05/01/2021, 21:27 - Wezz: I remember one night on the way home, asked the sausage man for one. And he said "No, you don't want that one". Made me want it even more, why's he keeping the sausage from me.

06/01/2021, 22:21 - Mike: nsfw warning
06/01/2021, 22:22 - Mike: Has that been confirmed by the news? thats intense
06/01/2021, 22:23 - Paul: I've talked on cnn a few times about how a there are 5 or 6 people in hospital and at least one person for sure got shot and is in critical condition
06/01/2021, 22:23 - Paul: They've* not me
06/01/2021, 22:23 - Mike: Glad you're doing the leg work
06/01/2021, 22:27 - Mike: Wonder if it was a protestor or the law that pulled the trigger
06/01/2021, 22:35 - Paul: Reportedly shot by police
07/01/2021, 01:06 - Noone: Haha the bitch is dead
07/01/2021, 01:09 - Noone: https://streamable.com/jneyxp
07/01/2021, 01:09 - Noone: Dumb bitch was climbing into a line of handguns. Theres a few other angles where you can see senators hiding under their desks as she gets popped
07/01/2021, 01:10 - Noone: Police let the protestors through the barricades.
07/01/2021, 01:11 - Noone: Pol are being such faggots about it though lol.
07/01/2021, 01:19 - Noone: <Media omitted>
07/01/2021, 08:53 - Wezz: What a weird situation. Biggest military in the history of the world. Boggles my mind how it wasn't stopped earlier.
07/01/2021, 08:58 - Lockers: because I thought trump said not to?
07/01/2021, 09:13 - Wezz: He was definitely encouraging it to move closer. Didn't see him call off any security response.
07/01/2021, 09:21 - Mike: Or at least knew about it beforehand? Apparently it was mostly organised through FB, surely they have tip off systems for that
07/01/2021, 09:28 - Wezz: He's been banned on twitter for 24 hours lol
07/01/2021, 10:26 - Dayle: bin("trump")
07/01/2021, 10:27 - Lockers: you so funny, I give that 101/1010

07/01/2021, 11:01 - Wezz: Maybe should have been an IT TRAINING WEBINAR
07/01/2021, 11:04 - Lockers: Dude, I'm with you on that one at the moment. Students are actually better than staff
07/01/2021, 11:31 - James: <Media omitted>
07/01/2021, 11:43 - Paul: In fairness, the first one has a certain creepy vibe to it too
07/01/2021, 13:07 - Wezz: Obama's a legend. Enjoyed going back and watching his speeches
07/01/2021, 13:08 - Wezz: The bar for speeches is nice and low. Shame Biden will still call over it and die
07/01/2021, 14:45 - Dayle: Drone King Obama?
07/01/2021, 14:45 - James: Exactly, he could have blown up the capitol building from the comfort of his armchair
07/01/2021, 14:58 - Derren: No idea why the security in that buildings aren't rifled or machine gunned up the max
07/01/2021, 14:58 - Derren: If I was trained and in there I would spray all those dickheads down as soon as they enter the building
07/01/2021, 15:00 - Wezz: People making the "if they were BLM protesters then it'd have been different" argument. Totally agree tbh.
07/01/2021, 15:00 - Wezz: Would have been Tiananmen Square 2.0
07/01/2021, 15:02 - Wezz: Probably that systemic racism everyone talks about. Perceived threat low and it just escalated ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇ
07/01/2021, 15:03 - Paul: This is a peak arm chair gamer moment
07/01/2021, 15:03 - Paul: Don't let Jack see this
07/01/2021, 15:04 - Derren: Like that cod game in the airport
07/01/2021, 15:06 - Wezz: Jack's established he's authoritarian through and through, even when it's proud boy related. Has to be those blue badge years üòç
07/01/2021, 15:06 - Wezz: Or maybe BDSM related...
07/01/2021, 15:07 - Wezz: Still figuring it out tbh
07/01/2021, 15:07 - Mike: Guy in my all staff who is an associate engineer just pronounced it "so shit engineer, er no I mean associate"
07/01/2021, 15:20 - Derren: Sounds like a great guy to learn from
07/01/2021, 15:34 - Paul: Oh he's for sure the type to be ball-gagged and tied up by a large coloured gentleman. The more he's against it, the better it feels
07/01/2021, 15:35 - Piper: Need to build a wall between Democrats and republicans
07/01/2021, 15:35 - Wezz: Who's gonna pay for it?
07/01/2021, 15:36 - Paul: Piper comes out with a banger at least once a month, it keeps me on my toes
07/01/2021, 15:40 - Piper: Chinah
07/01/2021, 15:41 - Wezz: Fuck yeah Piper 2024!
07/01/2021, 15:46 - Piper: I was class president year 8.. i will be happy to come back from retirement
07/01/2021, 16:19 - Lockers: You do seem like the kinda guy didn't have any friends to be fair. No offence Paul
07/01/2021, 16:19 - Piper: I was also a lemon in 3rd grade but never retired :(

pretty clear video of that chick being shot raiding the capitol building
07/01/2021, 17:48 - Wezz: omg nsfw
07/01/2021, 17:48 - Wezz: spat out my spaghettios
07/01/2021, 17:48 - Mike: I'm just glad the farmer was able to save the chick
07/01/2021, 17:52 - Wezz: I mean, I don't hear the guy shouting "GET THE FUCK DOWN" etc etc. Like in most of the cop vs white person videos. He just pew pews her. Guess that was the line. I wanna talk to that guy, ask him if his job is to not let anyone in the room or something. They need more guys like that at the entrance. Bloody America
07/01/2021, 17:53 - Mike: hes in a suit in another video, he aint the popo
07/01/2021, 17:53 - Wezz: Do we know his job?
07/01/2021, 17:54 - Mike: anti-trump door man
07/01/2021, 17:54 - Mike: People saying secret service, do they protect senators?
07/01/2021, 17:54 - Wezz: Yeah seeing a lot of 'secret service'. Maybe shouldn't be so secret about who's he gonna shoot
07/01/2021, 17:56 - Mike: Feel like a warning shot might have been enough but idk guns
07/01/2021, 17:56 - Wezz: Love how the comments are like "wow he popped her good"
07/01/2021, 17:57 - Wezz: she was a delusioned mess by the look of things
07/01/2021, 17:57 - Wezz: "she died for being stupid" "darwin award"
07/01/2021, 17:58 - Wezz: didn't see these comments on reddit when Floyd got killed
07/01/2021, 17:59 - Wezz: criminals be criminals. some collatoral
07/01/2021, 18:00 - Wezz: this is my opinion, didn't put in speech marks
07/01/2021, 18:00 - Mike: What makes her a mess? other than trying to storm a man with a gun
07/01/2021, 18:03 - Wezz: Her twitter feed mostly
07/01/2021, 18:04 - Kirky: theres a pic ture of a shot girl with her boob out getting cpr or whatever
07/01/2021, 18:04 - Kirky: someone printe dit out and came on it
07/01/2021, 18:04 - Kirky: thanks 4chan
07/01/2021, 18:04 - Wezz: The cirrrrrcle of liiiiiifeeeee
07/01/2021, 18:08 - Wezz: I'm also willing to admit my comparison is pretty weak. More trying to highlight the indifference on Reddit because of her beliefs. Fuck that site for any balanced discussion
07/01/2021, 18:12 - Mike: I mean its the entire site design that hinders discussion at extremes, would probably be solvable relatively quickly if they wanted to but it wont get them money so don't expect it. I'll try and keep an eye out for her twitter but I'm not expecting more than your average Trumpette (is that a word for female trump lovers or did I just invent it?)
07/01/2021, 18:13 - Wezz: Close but you missed the bit where they ban the opposing extreme views and harbour their own.
07/01/2021, 18:13 - Wezz: Yeah she just a crazy nationalist
07/01/2021, 18:14 - Wezz: Thinking she's protecting her country from undemocratic ways.
07/01/2021, 18:15 - Mike: Private entities do be self serving, can't stop that
07/01/2021, 18:16 - Mike: Crazy fervent or crazy mental problems? One gets sympathy other gets a bullet I guess
07/01/2021, 18:16 - Wezz: Depends on the way you spin it
07/01/2021, 18:21 - Dayle: Perfect example of it won't happen to me, people get big for their boots and get put down simple enough
07/01/2021, 18:22 - Dayle: Chat shit get hit in the simplist of terms haha
07/01/2021, 18:23 - Mike: Which one has the doctor's note? Usually settles it.
07/01/2021, 18:24 - Mike: Hopefully she didn't leave kids behind, they won't last long with the bullying from the democrats
07/01/2021, 18:26 - Wezz: Can just identify as an orphaned snail (they/them) and they'll be fine
07/01/2021, 18:26 - Wezz: +dead mum has to count for something
07/01/2021, 18:27 - Paul: She was a veteran too
07/01/2021, 18:28 - Paul: You'd think she'd know better
07/01/2021, 18:31 - Wezz: Yeah you're right Paul, deserved to be shot stupid bitch
07/01/2021, 18:33 - Wezz: Bet she drives a 12l too
07/01/2021, 18:34 - Wezz: I heard she puts milk before the water in her tea
07/01/2021, 18:37 - Mike: not in my experience
07/01/2021, 18:43 - Paul: Obviously not lol. But why is an ex vet storming the Capitol for a leader who has done nothing but insult and disrespect the armed forces
07/01/2021, 18:45 - Mike: "Nothing Will Stop Us," Tweeted Woman Before She Was Shot Dead At Capitol.

07/01/2021, 19:14 - Wezz: Here's my old 5 btc purchase
07/01/2021, 19:14 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
07/01/2021, 19:15 - Paul: How much is that worth now
07/01/2021, 19:15 - Wezz: 140,765.01 Pound sterling
07/01/2021, 19:16 - Paul: I traded an OG charizard card for a ditto because I liked it more
07/01/2021, 19:18 - Wezz: if it makes you feel better, only gem mint 10's are worth anything decent. plus 1st editions are when you get 6 figures
07/01/2021, 19:19 - Paul: My mum offered to buy me one of those giant boxes of cards from a megastore before it got popular to cheer me up but I didn't know what Pokemon was and said no
07/01/2021, 19:20 - Wezz: That'd be a good 40k, 300k+ for a 1st edition
07/01/2021, 19:21 - Derren: doubt you'd have purchased first edition boxes or packs man
07/01/2021, 19:21 - Paul: Oh let's be fair I'd have opened every card and lost them all along with all the others over the years lol
07/01/2021, 19:21 - Derren: they're quite rare
07/01/2021, 19:22 - Derren: albion üëÄ
07/01/2021, 19:22 - Paul: Chris had some insanely rare cards I remember. Some happy birthday pikachu set that's worth a ton now

11/01/2021, 13:50 - Derren: But like some of the comments say, you get these weird feelings from that game as a kid but he does a good job at explaining the things you feel etc
11/01/2021, 13:51 - Derren: Like going back to kokiri forest and nobody knowing you, knowing navi flies away so you can't go back to the place you started, losing all your companions in the game etc

11/01/2021, 15:15 - Wezz: Will run out of steam soon as inauguration goes through, just a looming threat.

Media/Dems will dip into the 'Trump messed everything up' pile as scapegoat when necessary for next 4 years. Biden will die in 2023. Musk will share a spag bol with me in 2025 in his air conditioned spacecraft orbiting planet ‚Ñ¢‚Ç¨¬Æ√∑{.
11/01/2021, 15:21 - Wezz: In 2028 Mike will pentakill with Garen. 2030 someone from this WhatsApp group will die statistically (aka made it up). 2031 Paul will become Jewish. 2031 Kirky will move to Botswana.

12/01/2021, 12:33 - Mike: Getting furloughed

12/01/2021, 12:40 - Derren: Is it not still 80%?
12/01/2021, 12:40 - Kirky: Right answer. I'd fucking love to be furloughed
12/01/2021, 12:41 - Lockers: Dunno, that's why I'm asking. I thought it was up to 2.5k or something but dunno if I'm making that up. Haven't paid much attention as it'll never happen to me lol
12/01/2021, 12:41 - James: Never going to happen, software doesn't care if the fleshy meat bodies are dying, the code must flow
12/01/2021, 12:41 - Derren: when it happened initially it was 80% of your salary paid by gov up to 30k a year
12/01/2021, 12:42 - James: Implying anyone should be upset with 30k a year for doing nothing
12/01/2021, 12:43 - Derren: it's 80% of 30k
12/01/2021, 12:43 - Derren: your company is responsible for giving the last 20%
12/01/2021, 12:43 - Derren: I dunno if it changed to 66% now
12/01/2021, 13:04 - Wezz: No fucking way.
12/01/2021, 13:04 - Wezz: Mike, if you get furloughed, can you just remake shit arm so we can all die happy

12/01/2021, 15:03 - James: It was so good
12/01/2021, 15:28 - Wezz: Ah I was offered tickets to that show! Couldn't make it cause wasn't in UK... Glory days when we could goto gigs and get flights üò´
12/01/2021, 15:30 - James: It's weird, my first thought with the picture you sent was "Oof, is he trying to kill off disabled people?" Social distancing has rewired my brain
12/01/2021, 15:39 - Paul: Nice
12/01/2021, 16:21 - Paul: When was the last time any of you had a family bucket from kfc
12/01/2021, 16:26 - Kirky: Too long ago üò≠
12/01/2021, 16:28 - Lockers: Never had one
12/01/2021, 16:29 - Paul: It used to be a fun treat we'd get over a mates house for a sleepover or something as a kid
12/01/2021, 16:31 - Paul: https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-2-0/
12/01/2021, 16:31 - Paul: New valorant season coming with big update
12/01/2021, 16:31 - Paul: Which means rank soft reset too
12/01/2021, 16:32 - Wezz: It's some psychological game.. he gets us excited talking about KFC then hits us with the valorant patch notes. Positivity by association.
12/01/2021, 16:32 - Kirky: New league season  also just started
12/01/2021, 16:33 - Paul: Look at these fluffy kittens! Oh and anyone else love valorant??
12/01/2021, 16:34 - Wezz: Lool almost got me to download it again.
12/01/2021, 16:35 - Lockers: Don't like fluffy kittens or KFC üñï
12/01/2021, 16:36 - Paul: Who doesn't like kfc get out
12/01/2021, 17:11 - Dayle: <Media omitted>
12/01/2021, 17:12 - Kirky: BUMRS DONT NEED PRACTISE TO BUM
12/01/2021, 17:13 - Kirky: ITS INBUILT
12/01/2021, 17:13 - Paul: Don't really think I need any practise
12/01/2021, 17:14 - Lockers: +1 I know where my q is on my keyboard
12/01/2021, 17:50 - Wezz: Real practice is a dress rehearsal... Shots in chat?
12/01/2021, 17:54 - Lockers: ON A TUESDAY
12/01/2021, 18:03 - Kirky: Clash sat Sunday right ? Not Friday?
12/01/2021, 18:03 - Kirky: Friday can be dress rehearsal
12/01/2021, 18:15 - Wezz: I feel like hungover BUMRS is an unknown. What if I sleep until 6pm and miss registration
12/01/2021, 18:16 - Wezz: ...I'm in.
12/01/2021, 18:17 - Kirky: Temporary mute the phone so we can ring at 5pm
12/01/2021, 19:53 - Piper: There's a new series/maybe old called lupin
12/01/2021, 19:53 - Piper: Very cool so far
12/01/2021, 19:54 - Piper: Definitely should watch
12/01/2021, 19:54 - Piper: French English dubbed
12/01/2021, 19:59 - Kirky: Yea it's old
12/01/2021, 19:59 - Kirky: I had it all downloaded once
12/01/2021, 19:59 - Dayle: come play league
12/01/2021, 19:59 - Dayle: piper ffs
12/01/2021, 20:23 - Paul: Pick up a piper penguin
12/01/2021, 22:49 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
13/01/2021, 01:28 - Noone: They're voting on enacting the 25th amendment, the yeas have it so far
13/01/2021, 01:32 - Noone: No they don't, it needs 2/3 in the house rip
13/01/2021, 08:48 - Mike: 17 republicans need to vote to impeach, only Romney did last time. The times reporting 20 republicans have stated they are open to the idea though. Could be they see it as a chance for the party to make a clean break from trump's cult though.
13/01/2021, 08:54 - Wezz: If they did invoke. Wonder if it would effect him in court RE mental health? That'd be weird
13/01/2021, 08:55 - Mike: What do you mean?
13/01/2021, 09:08 - Wezz: Well, my understanding was Pence was invoking the 25th as Trump is 'mentally unfit'. I wonder if this would have affected his expected court battles post-presidency. All a bit irrelevant now. Impeach is the next headline, move along
13/01/2021, 09:15 - Mike: That was the democrat request before they started impeachment, probably because they knew impeachment was a lot less likely. Pence said no because he felt it was usurpation, so now there is a President who has been impeached twice but probably never convicted.
13/01/2021, 09:28 - Paul: You can't sue me for my embezzlement crimes new York. I have this document signed by the entire us Senate confirming I'm a retard
13/01/2021, 09:29 - Paul: If he gets removed from office I win a long standing bet with Connor. Even if it's right at the buzzer
13/01/2021, 09:29 - Mike: With the document signed, the radical left rally around Trump as their new boy
13/01/2021, 09:30 - Lockers: Silly Connor
13/01/2021, 09:31 - Paul: Nah he's just a pretty hard-core libertarian who thinks they are all useless cunts. Hard to argue
13/01/2021, 09:32 - Paul: I saw that even Moscow Mitch has said impeachment is on the table
13/01/2021, 09:32 - Paul: That's big
13/01/2021, 09:32 - Paul: He's the devil
13/01/2021, 10:19 - Noone: Pence said earlier yesterday why he wouldn't invoke the 25th amendment. It would also need to get through their equivalent of house of lords which it wouldn't
13/01/2021, 11:04 - Wezz: Pretty good fallacious excuse
13/01/2021, 11:09 - Wezz: I feel Trump GG'd a lot of his hardcore fans when he read that ‚úíÔ∏èstatement.

Complete 180 and hard to be misinterpreted. I wonder who/what pushed him to read it, legal repercussions? Doubt he's condemning his die hards lightly
13/01/2021, 14:33 - Dayle: speaking of gaming - we gaming tonight boys?
13/01/2021, 14:33 - Paul: Valorant?
13/01/2021, 14:34 - Dayle: Uninstalled it i would rather swing from a skyscraper by my genitals until they popped under my weight then falling to my inevitable death
13/01/2021, 14:35 - Paul: What is league of legends
13/01/2021, 14:35 - Dayle: a better game
13/01/2021, 14:35 - Paul: What is an incorrect statement
13/01/2021, 14:36 - Dayle: slap me in with trump then im riding this horse from old town road
13/01/2021, 14:36 - Paul: What is jeopardy
13/01/2021, 14:36 - Wezz: What is RIP lol ded
13/01/2021, 14:37 - Wezz: Meta
13/01/2021, 14:38 - Paul: I'm So Meta Even This Acronym
13/01/2021, 14:38 - James: I suck mangoes, especially tight anus
13/01/2021, 14:39 - Paul: What is league of legends
13/01/2021, 14:40 - Dayle: its a collection of a historical beings, albeit not authenticated.
13/01/2021, 14:43 - James: What is antiques roadshow?
13/01/2021, 14:43 - Dayle: old shit, on show on the road
13/01/2021, 14:44 - Paul: Oooh what is antiques roadshow
13/01/2021, 14:44 - James: I know this one, what is the last question that was asked?
13/01/2021, 14:45 - Paul: What is James' new answer
13/01/2021, 14:46 - James: Ah, Alex, I believe this is "What does the fox say?"
13/01/2021, 14:46 - Paul: I am dead
13/01/2021, 14:47 - James: I think that one is "What does Paul say most of the time when playing video games?"
13/01/2021, 14:48 - Paul: Thanks Jim that was way more fun than any other games
13/01/2021, 16:39 - Kirky: <Media omitted>
13/01/2021, 17:13 - Wezz: What is uncle visiting for a family dinner?
13/01/2021, 17:14 - Wezz: OCEAN MAN
13/01/2021, 17:48 - Dayle: <Media omitted>
13/01/2021, 17:48 - Kirky: TAKE ME BY THE HAND
13/01/2021, 18:02 - Wezz: I'll be on! In 30
13/01/2021, 18:08 - Wezz: Anyone watching impeachment debate? Bloody Americans loool
13/01/2021, 18:27 - Kirky: Can play at like 7
13/01/2021, 18:30 - Wezz: Sweet, will be on for then
13/01/2021, 18:34 - Tapan: LEAD ME TO THE LAND
13/01/2021, 18:36 - Wezz: @447758520258, what's your favourite fruit?
13/01/2021, 18:37 - Lockers: Banana
13/01/2021, 18:37 - Wezz: A particular banana?
13/01/2021, 18:38 - Lockers: A yellow banana
13/01/2021, 18:38 - Wezz: Thanks
13/01/2021, 18:38 - Lockers: From Panama
13/01/2021, 18:38 - Lockers: according to the one I have here
13/01/2021, 18:39 - Wezz: Panamabanana
13/01/2021, 18:40 - Wezz: Nice.
13/01/2021, 18:42 - Mike: I just said this to Jack walking around Sainsbury's
13/01/2021, 18:42 - Mike: Great minds
13/01/2021, 18:43 - Mike: He also replied my dick
13/01/2021, 18:43 - Wezz: You asked what Lockers' favourite fruit is?
13/01/2021, 18:43 - Wezz: ‚âà banana
13/01/2021, 18:47 - Derren: Correct answer = Mango
13/01/2021, 18:57 - Lockers: Wrong answer = whatever Derek says
13/01/2021, 18:57 - Lockers: Although
13/01/2021, 18:57 - Lockers: I love da mango
13/01/2021, 18:58 - Derren: I thought your answer would be jack fruit
13/01/2021, 18:59 - Lockers: Not sure I've ever tried it
13/01/2021, 19:06 - Wezz: @447835575116 @447943624891 you guys should watch this impeachment live stream and conclude how shit both parties are. Embarrassing. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-9atMTUVW8
13/01/2021, 19:09 - Kirky: <Media omitted>
13/01/2021, 19:10 - James: More like Va-Janna, amiright?
13/01/2021, 19:10 - Lockers: I'm watching now. Too stupid to understand the big words hurrrr durrrr
13/01/2021, 19:11 - Wezz: Enjoying all the old fogies and puppets. The dichotomy illusion of bs politics. Preferring either party is naive.
13/01/2021, 19:14 - Lockers: I didn't realise the Russia thing was completely falsified, thought there was a lot that wasn't concluded
13/01/2021, 19:17 - Lockers: What's the matter with new York? Fucking pussy
13/01/2021, 19:18 - Wezz: hahah big chungus right there
13/01/2021, 19:21 - Wezz: The whole thing is embarrassing.
13/01/2021, 19:22 - Lockers: The size of the cunt
13/01/2021, 19:22 - Lockers: They're all repeating themselves
13/01/2021, 19:24 - Lockers: The old man points so aggressively with his foggy glasses
13/01/2021, 19:24 - Lockers: That'll get his POINT ACROSS. GEDDIT? POINT
13/01/2021, 19:24 - Lockers: This is fun. Thanks wezz
13/01/2021, 19:25 - Wezz: Had a scandal every week for the last 4 years... bit like cold reading. You most remember the hits.
13/01/2021, 19:28 - Lockers: HER MASK SAYS CENSORED
13/01/2021, 19:28 - Lockers: I can't hear what she's saying
13/01/2021, 19:29 - Wezz: Looooool
13/01/2021, 19:30 - Wezz: So many black dems claiming white supremacy with BLM masks on
13/01/2021, 19:32 - Wezz: like, incoherent ranting without reference
13/01/2021, 19:32 - Paul: Because it wasn't. Trump and his cronies actively disrupted the investigation and refused to cooperate. Mueller found 10 instances of obstruction of justice. He even directly said that the reason there were no indictments was a DOJ memo claiming you can't convict a sitting president.
13/01/2021, 19:33 - Paul: And then trump was like LOL SEE NO COLLUSION despite that not even being a legal term
13/01/2021, 19:33 - Paul: Also yeah I'm watching wezz üëåüèª
13/01/2021, 19:35 - Paul: The dems bringing up race so much is just so unnecessary
13/01/2021, 19:35 - Paul: Like they need the extra ammo atm
13/01/2021, 19:35 - Wezz: It's the bandwagoning left
13/01/2021, 19:36 - Wezz: Making the conservatives seem reasonable. Thought it was impossible
13/01/2021, 19:36 - Paul: Dunno about that
13/01/2021, 19:37 - Lockers: Thought so
13/01/2021, 19:38 - Lockers: It's the way people communicate at the moment, everyone is a victim
13/01/2021, 19:38 - Lockers: Bit far mate
13/01/2021, 19:39 - Paul: Aren't you a BNP member
13/01/2021, 19:39 - Wezz: They were saying stuff like "our nation needs peace right now during a difficult handover of power"
13/01/2021, 19:39 - Wezz: this kinda shit
13/01/2021, 19:39 - Paul: Can we just go to the vote. Far more interested in the Senate part
13/01/2021, 19:40 - Lockers: Yeah BNP teacher
13/01/2021, 19:40 - Lockers: Is that happening after this?
13/01/2021, 19:41 - Lockers: Also the fact they're incapable of keeping time is rather embarrassing
13/01/2021, 19:41 - Paul: Could go on for a while. I watched the house hearings for several days last time. Then it went to the Senate and they refused to hear witnesses and said nah
13/01/2021, 19:41 - Wezz: This is the GOOD STUFF! Pure unadulterated politics.
13/01/2021, 19:42 - Paul: Yeah but this is the house. Its already a forgone conclusion that it'll pass in the house
13/01/2021, 19:43 - Paul: But the Senate could be exciting this time. As a lot of republicans have said they are willing to vote him out... Even Mitch McConnell
13/01/2021, 19:44 - Paul: COUNT THE VOTE
13/01/2021, 19:48 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
13/01/2021, 19:50 - Lockers: I love that for all the old birds they call them young ladies
13/01/2021, 19:51 - Lockers: So patronising
13/01/2021, 19:53 - Wezz: Whole system is outdated. "Gentlewoman". They barely utilise IT, could have a timer and queue/order. Argos checkout style lol
13/01/2021, 19:53 - Paul: Mics should switch off when time expires
13/01/2021, 19:53 - Paul: It's the debates all over again
13/01/2021, 19:54 - Lockers: Exactly what I'm saying, we could host a better debate on discord
13/01/2021, 19:54 - Wezz: Our Among Us games are better moderated.
13/01/2021, 19:54 - Lockers: Or in fact on that pokemon style website Paul and mic used for Christmas party
13/01/2021, 19:54 - Lockers: Mic? Mike
13/01/2021, 19:54 - Paul: I love the black guys that come up and sleep super slowly and get 30 seconds lmao
13/01/2021, 19:54 - Paul: Speak*
13/01/2021, 19:55 - Lockers: Yeah I thought he was actually on his death bed
13/01/2021, 19:57 - Lockers: Has he gone silent or what
13/01/2021, 19:57 - Lockers: Wtf
13/01/2021, 19:57 - Wezz: looool
13/01/2021, 19:57 - Lockers: Has the sound gone?
13/01/2021, 19:57 - Lockers: Hahahahaha he was actually waiting
13/01/2021, 19:57 - Paul: Erm
13/01/2021, 19:57 - Lockers: That was the most awkward thing ever
13/01/2021, 19:57 - Paul: LOL
13/01/2021, 19:58 - Paul: Someone claps hahahaha
13/01/2021, 19:58 - Lockers: Is this actually an official thing? Like this isn't a comedy no?
13/01/2021, 19:58 - Paul: I think he was trying to make a point
13/01/2021, 19:58 - Wezz: Imagine being 'madam speaker'. What a fucking job man
13/01/2021, 19:59 - Paul: ORDAH ORDAH
13/01/2021, 20:00 - Lockers: Shes got two things to say
13/01/2021, 20:00 - Wezz: "I rise with a very simple question. On January 6th, thousands broke the law by taking siege of our capital with us inside. Has any...._one_ of those individuals who brought violence on our capital, been brought here to answer whether they did that because of our president?"..............................................................
13/01/2021, 20:00 - Wezz: He really digged that
13/01/2021, 20:20 - Kirky: <Media omitted>
13/01/2021, 20:20 - Lockers: ON A TUES... oh its an advert
13/01/2021, 20:23 - Wezz: mate, i've never played no 4 real fishing frenzy
13/01/2021, 20:23 - Wezz: i've never won no money on it either, they just making things up!

14/01/2021, 01:21 - Mike: What's the world coming to when piers like competent?
14/01/2021, 01:22 - Mike: Still I'm also really glad, very glad
14/01/2021, 01:33 - Wezz: I know right...it's almost like people aren't either good or bad. Hope my ideology can guide me in these trying times
14/01/2021, 08:01 - Qck: Piers Morgan is the exception to this rule
14/01/2021, 08:02 - Paul: This is wrong. Anyone with this opinion is bad
14/01/2021, 08:21 - Paul: https://mobile.twitter.com/ReesusP/status/1349255972829630465
14/01/2021, 08:21 - Paul: Dude these guys were legit planning on a lot more in the capitol it seems.
14/01/2021, 08:24 - Lockers: I missed what was said?
14/01/2021, 08:25 - Lockers: the looking down the camera bit
14/01/2021, 08:26 - Paul: Time?
14/01/2021, 08:27 - Lockers: It's literally what the tweet says
14/01/2021, 08:27 - Lockers: oh I read stared down the barrel as like looking into the camera
14/01/2021, 08:28 - Paul: Dunno what you're on about m8
14/01/2021, 08:30 - Lockers: "When @maddow stared down the barrel and asked trump what did he think was gonna happen tonight I got goosebumps."
14/01/2021, 08:31 - Lockers: have you used twitter? There's a caption attached to the video
14/01/2021, 08:33 - Wezz: üòÇüòÇ
14/01/2021, 08:34 - Paul: Yeah I just don't understand what's confusing you
14/01/2021, 08:36 - Lockers: When I read "staring down the barrel" I was expecting someone to stare down the camera
14/01/2021, 08:36 - Lockers: These old people man üôÑ
14/01/2021, 08:37 - Qck: Nah the tweet refers to Rachel Maddow being killed by firing squad last night on Trump's orders
14/01/2021, 08:37 - Qck: The barrel refers to a 12-gauge
14/01/2021, 08:38 - Paul: Says the guy who doesn't know the phrase "staring down the barrel"
14/01/2021, 08:39 - Qck: Are you implying that only young people use the phrase "staring down the barrel" as you're quite right
14/01/2021, 08:40 - Paul: It's hip with us non-squares
14/01/2021, 08:40 - Lockers: Lol you're round
14/01/2021, 08:40 - Paul: Dude leave me alone jesus

14/01/2021, 11:36 - Noone: Big claim to fame though, being the first member of "Misto's CSS fan club"
14/01/2021, 11:38 - Wezz: I'm glad that Misto's only fan club is an ironic fan club made by his friends
14/01/2021, 11:38 - Noone: This year his fan club doubled its numbers which is quite good
14/01/2021, 11:39 - Noone: I joined it this summer, making me the 2nd member

14/01/2021, 13:20 - Lockers: ???
14/01/2021, 13:21 - Wezz: I don't think they would ban. We can spin a wheel and person that it lands on has to swap out

15/01/2021, 16:21 - Wezz: Right. Can you tell that to Mike and his 'everyone gets a medal' BUMRs placard. T shirt numbers represent kills+assists! Kirky on 59 can suck my dick, all he did was heal people getting kills bullshit game

Kirky after his fourth pint of clash vodka
18/01/2021, 11:21 - Kirky: <Media omitted>
18/01/2021, 11:22 - Wezz: Surprised he got his Johnson out first.
18/01/2021, 11:22 - Lockers: bit gay
18/01/2021, 11:25 - James: I'm impressed at all the people justifying pissing themselves as a rite of passage to having fun
18/01/2021, 11:26 - Noone: Take that back right now
18/01/2021, 11:59 - Paul: When I first met Mike I had no idea what he looked like as he used a fake photo on the elite clan killers forum
18/01/2021, 12:00 - Lockers: Fucking eck community lmao
18/01/2021, 12:00 - Paul: When I first met Jack lockley I had to have a chat with his mum because she was scared to leave him with internet strangers
18/01/2021, 12:00 - Lockers: This is true, I mean I was still at school and it's not like we could video chat
18/01/2021, 12:02 - Lockers: How many different teams though? I remember someone making me rep the tag once
18/01/2021, 12:03 - Paul: Looking back they were super creepy. They had a jailbait subforum that, at the time being 16, didn't really mind. But a lot of the guys were in their 30s
18/01/2021, 12:04 - Paul: And I remember one of them whacked his dick out in the iseries bar to show off his dick piercing to a bunch of 15 year old boys
18/01/2021, 12:05 - Wezz: It's funny how jailbait was an acceptable 4chan term for a long time. Same way 'teen' is a common search term. Feels totally weird now.
18/01/2021, 12:06 - Wezz: Louis CK does a bit on it, feeling like a responsible parent instead of enjoying Wet and Wild: 2 Hot to Handle
18/01/2021, 12:06 - Wezz: That's weird. If you're getting a dick piercing you're already on the periphery of society
18/01/2021, 12:07 - Paul: I'm actually pretty sure eck were swingers. They had these meetups that would get 'wild'
18/01/2021, 12:08 - Lockers: Yeah I remember just thinking it was the norm squeaking down the mic at older men. Didn't come across anything too weird though tbf (ba dum tsch)
18/01/2021, 12:08 - Paul: I remember drew getting an absolute berating from a 40 year old fat dude called bullet magnet
18/01/2021, 12:09 - Paul: Because drew raged at him in cs or something. And something with misto and a woman called tetley
18/01/2021, 12:09 - Paul: Here comes pedobear haha what jolly good fun
18/01/2021, 12:10 - Lockers: Derek pissing off the opposite gender? Well I never
18/01/2021, 12:10 - Lockers: Nuts that this was only ~15 years ago
18/01/2021, 12:11 - Wezz: Yeah age makes it fine. I was 15 at the time so obv into girls closer to my age.
18/01/2021, 12:11 - Wezz: Perspective. All the kids doing the same thing on snapchat nbd

18/01/2021, 12:31 - Derren: And making drama from it
18/01/2021, 12:31 - Derren: Clearly she has much bigger life issues she needs to look into
18/01/2021, 12:33 - Lockers: Sounds like you might do too m8
18/01/2021, 12:39 - Derren: Had to have a meeting with a bunch of 40 year olds lol

18/01/2021, 14:34 - Qck: *series
18/01/2021, 14:35 - Qck: Does anyone have breath of the wild and can I borrow it?
18/01/2021, 14:42 - Wezz: Colleague banging on about this this morning.
18/01/2021, 14:42 - Wezz: Any good?
18/01/2021, 14:51 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
18/01/2021, 14:59 - James: Watched an interesting video recently about how Uber just doesn't work as a business model, and they have been hemmoraging cash from day one, and Uber eats etc is their way of staying afloat by doing things that actually are profitable
18/01/2021, 15:02 - Qck: Yeah pretty sure uber eats only recently turned a profit too, can you really put a price on big data tho
18/01/2021, 15:02 - Qck: Every episode is like the worst futurama episode of a season, so yeah it's pretty good
18/01/2021, 15:03 - Wezz: Interesting. Didn't they try and essentially absolve liability in UK court, e.g. someone crashes in an Uber car = they're not involved at all?

Just assumed their business model was acting as an automated middle man for taxi->customer. Collect 20% per journey and rake in the ¬£?
18/01/2021, 15:05 - Wezz: Uber eats added a 'order fee' section roughly 6 months ago, usually ~10% of order total. Before there just used to be delivery fee and I'd often get it free. They just wanted heavy adoption, monopolise the market then increase fees?
18/01/2021, 15:06 - Paul: It starts weak and gets better.
18/01/2021, 15:09 - Wezz: This fills me with no hope
18/01/2021, 15:10 - Qck: Just feel like there's a 200ms delay between correct comedic timing and whatever disenchantment is doing
18/01/2021, 15:10 - James: I think that's the idea, but their cut doesn't cover salaries/marketing/expenses IIRC
18/01/2021, 15:10 - Qck: But it's still good, just easy to critique
18/01/2021, 15:13 - Wezz: Eric Andre casting was the hope I had. Will give it a go
18/01/2021, 15:19 - Nathan: Yessssss. On Netflix?
18/01/2021, 15:22 - Qck: Nah it's on Rakuten
18/01/2021, 15:22 - Qck: Rakuten TV is the only button I've never pressed on a smart t.v. remote
18/01/2021, 15:22 - Qck: Who are these Rakuten viewers?
18/01/2021, 15:23 - Lockers: I watched it once for the Barcelona fc documentary
18/01/2021, 15:23 - Lockers: By the way, fc stands for football club
18/01/2021, 15:23 - Qck: What does Barcelona stand for
18/01/2021, 15:23 - Lockers: Ya mum wheyyyy
18/01/2021, 15:26 - Qck: Would have been better if you said an independent Catalonia but whatever
18/01/2021, 15:28 - Paul: That's giving way too much credit to a football teacher
18/01/2021, 15:28 - Paul: This is a really solid way to describe it lol
18/01/2021, 15:29 - Lockers: +1
18/01/2021, 15:29 - Lockers: hey I've been to Barcelona I know what I said and I meant it

19/01/2021, 13:44 - Wezz: Anyone know any good poems?

Enjoyed this one by Philip Larkin! Don‚Äôt worry mummy - you didn‚Äôt fuck me up!

‚ÄúThey fuck you up, your mum and dad.
They may not mean to, but they do.
They fill you with the faults they had
And add some extra, just for you.

But they were fucked up in their turn
By fools in old-style hats and coats,
Who half the time were soppy-stern
And half at one another's throats.

Man hands on misery to man.
It deepens like a coastal shelf.
Get out as early as you can,
And don't have any kids yourself.‚Äù
19/01/2021, 13:53 - Mike: Gonna hand that one in a card to your kids?
19/01/2021, 13:48 - Paul: We read that in 6th form when we studied Larkin and Plath. The documentary about Larkin was one of the most boring things I've ever seen lol
19/01/2021, 13:52 - Kirky: 10/10
19/01/2021, 13:53 - Lockers: Few case studies to back this poem up...
19/01/2021, 14:02 - Wezz: So; if Kirky was to do a tequila slammer in his work van + uniform Infront of a police man and drive away. Votes please

Would he:
A. Be Arrested
B. Lose his job
C. Be completely fine
19/01/2021, 14:03 - Kirky: Assuming I'm under the legal limit
19/01/2021, 14:05 - Mike: Are his keys in ignition during the slam?
19/01/2021, 14:07 - Wezz: Yeah. He's at a red light
19/01/2021, 14:09 - Lockers: A + sent on a course
19/01/2021, 14:11 - Paul: I'd go with A most likely B minimum
19/01/2021, 14:12 - Kirky: My town has like 2 cop cars so I reckon I could get away with it
19/01/2021, 14:12 - Kirky: With a mint
19/01/2021, 14:12 - Paul: Is it obvious to the policeman that it's alcohol? Is it from a big jug with X X X on it
19/01/2021, 14:14 - Mike: Fine
19/01/2021, 14:16 - Wezz: 100% he's doing a shot of tequila
19/01/2021, 14:16 - Wezz: But he's not over the limit on a breathalyser
19/01/2021, 14:16 - Paul: As in he'll be fine? Or he'll get a fine?
19/01/2021, 14:18 - Paul: "While you are certain to be arrested for suspicion of driving under the influence (DUI) when your BAC is at or over 0.08%, you can still be charged if your BAC is at any level above 0.00%."
19/01/2021, 14:19 - Mike: Fined*
19/01/2021, 14:21 - Paul: There's only 2 ways this plays out:
1. The policeman stops him and has to write him up
2. The policeman is so gobsmacked at the sheer audacity of this kid that he just sits there in disbelief
19/01/2021, 14:22 - Wezz: Swap the tequila for a shot of beer
19/01/2021, 14:22 - Kirky: Theres currently no way I'd not lose my job seeing as I was caught speeding a year ago
19/01/2021, 14:22 - Wezz: Same situation?
19/01/2021, 14:23 - Kirky: 49 weeks and I can do it again !
19/01/2021, 14:23 - James: Somehow my dad kept his job after flipping his work truck a few years ago
19/01/2021, 14:23 - Kirky: Was he doing tequila slammers at a red light ?
19/01/2021, 14:24 - Paul: Yeah I reckon so. The policeman has to at least investigate it, if hes that brazen in broad daylight
19/01/2021, 14:25 - James: No, he told them he was run off the road into a ditch. What actually happened is he was in the middle of nowhere and wanted to take lunch, and he saw an open field, so he took his truck in there and started doing donuts. He then had to call my mum and I to bring the land rover to tow him the right way up again as his wheel hooked in the grass and flipped him.
19/01/2021, 14:25 - Wezz: What a champion
19/01/2021, 14:25 - Kirky: My fucking hero that's my afternoon collection sorted
19/01/2021, 14:26 - Paul: I want lunch but I didn't bring anything - I know! I'll do doughnuts! Then eat them!
19/01/2021, 14:26 - James: Mmmm, donuts
19/01/2021, 14:47 - Kirky: So the consensus is I DONT do a shot at the light on Friday to make up for lost drinking time?
19/01/2021, 14:47 - Kirky: Or atleast shouldn't
19/01/2021, 14:48 - Paul: Well that entirely depends on the outcome you want
19/01/2021, 15:00 - Mike: And if you brought enough for the copper
19/01/2021, 15:14 - Wezz: Dayle told me he's happy to represent you in court
19/01/2021, 15:17 - Kirky: Dayle, as my legal council, if I recorded said shot for the group chat would I be more likely to get off ?
19/01/2021, 16:50 - Paul: Opposing council already dreading how many times they'll have to object to being told to get in the bin
19/01/2021, 17:37 - Dayle: We gaming?
19/01/2021, 17:38 - Dayle: May the council approach... we need to have a break so I can catch up
19/01/2021, 17:39 - Dayle: I think if Kirkton drunk himself sober enough it will be fine
19/01/2021, 17:42 - Kirky: Well I was never intending to be drunk. Its just 1 shot at the lights, cheers the cops
19/01/2021, 17:43 - Mike: Depends what you mean by get off
19/01/2021, 17:43 - Dayle: Send this man to the dog house
19/01/2021, 17:49 - Wezz: Dayle racking up lines in the courthouse
19/01/2021, 17:50 - Mike: A form of civil disobedience I'd say, me being Dayle's lawyer
19/01/2021, 17:51 - Wezz: In other news, UFC 257 Embedded ep 1 is out:

You should all get on the hype train for this Saturday!
19/01/2021, 17:55 - Dayle: not anymore mate im a changed man :d
19/01/2021, 17:56 - Dayle: im just about to jump in a solo anyone down TF?
19/01/2021, 18:03 - Tapan: I legit thought Dana white was one of the airplane staff until I noticed the edgy twat wasn't wearing a mask üòÇ
19/01/2021, 18:03 - Wezz: Gonna eat and chill just got home üëå
19/01/2021, 18:04 - Wezz: He's always been a dick about it tbh. Whenever on cam he doesn't wear one. At weighins etc.
19/01/2021, 18:05 - Wezz: Tbf to him he carried sports through covid and paved the way for other programs. Definitely risked health in the process but fighters consent to anything lolz
19/01/2021, 18:05 - Tapan: It doesn't surprise me tbf, he did buy his own island to dodge regulations
19/01/2021, 18:06 - Kirky: Funnily enough I pulled up next to a police van in Woodstock out side the post office. No glass on me to test it though unfortunately
19/01/2021, 18:06 - Tapan: Yeah fair point, I guess they all sign up for it
19/01/2021, 18:06 - Tapan: Should have asked them out the window if they have any
19/01/2021, 18:07 - Tapan: They might be feeling helpful
19/01/2021, 18:07 - Wezz: Funny how the press spin these kinda things. He just used Yas Island. Abu Dhabi were pretty smart and kept an area 'covid free'. Forced tests on boundaries and had a 'purgatory' zone for people flying in for the shows.

20/01/2021, 15:23 - James: I can't speak for the vagina master Wezz, but I'm imagining that they are the same as a single vagina, but it plateaus just above the enjoyment of a single vagina, so you can't double the fun

23/01/2021, 10:02 - James: Chalk that up to my bad picture haha, I've passed the compliments to the chef though!
23/01/2021, 10:03 - Noone: How did she make the frogs sit up like that? Do you have to let it dry layer by layer or something?
23/01/2021, 10:06 - James: I think it's fondant, so you model it like clay

25/01/2021, 16:58 - Lockers: Surely it'll only work on accounts that receive that notification?
25/01/2021, 16:58 - Lockers: Also they spelt your name wrong

25/01/2021, 17:39 - Qck: Is Derek trying to MLM us into mcdonalds
25/01/2021, 17:39 - Qck: Is that how far he's sunk
25/01/2021, 17:39 - Qck: Since getting fired by Ronald all those years ago
25/01/2021, 17:39 - Wezz: Once you go Mac, you can't go back
25/01/2021, 17:41 - Derren: I left ;(
25/01/2021, 17:41 - Qck: More like "put down the mac and don't come back" during Derek's disciplinary with Ronald
25/01/2021, 17:42 - Qck: Yeeaah, not what I've been telling people

25/01/2021, 17:44 - Paul: Did it clarify Turkish Cypriot?
25/01/2021, 17:44 - Qck: Isn't it Greek Cypriot
25/01/2021, 17:45 - Wezz: Exact message was:
"Oops! You're already a fat loyal customer, no promos for you!"
25/01/2021, 17:45 - Qck: I thought we all decided long ago that cyprus is like an even shitter crete and so must belong to the Greeks
25/01/2021, 17:45 - Qck: Or has something changed
25/01/2021, 17:45 - Paul: Did you check with Wezz first if that one was OK?
25/01/2021, 17:46 - Wezz: I thought we won it in a deal or no deal game?
25/01/2021, 17:46 - Wezz: Got 10¬£, no dealt and lost
25/01/2021, 17:47 - Qck: No it's only when I'm writing something that someone might get insulted by that I need to double check first
25/01/2021, 17:47 - Qck: I mean all the disrespect to Derek
25/01/2021, 17:48 - Paul: Ah right I thought it was just in general like a sub/dom thing
25/01/2021, 17:48 - James: Crete is pretty cool, it has the Palace of Knossos and is surrounded by the Mediterranean
25/01/2021, 17:48 - Qck: A Paul/Julia thing
25/01/2021, 17:49 - Paul: Great for a lads night out too
25/01/2021, 17:49 - James: Don't let Julia see that, Paul will get a beating for revealing their relationship secrets
25/01/2021, 17:49 - Qck: Piper can you find out what Mediterranean Progeny is for me
25/01/2021, 17:49 - James: www.lpgtfy.com
25/01/2021, 17:50 - Noone: Piper can you check what Mediterranean Progeny is please
25/01/2021, 17:52 - Paul: Joke's on you
25/01/2021, 17:56 - Wezz: Piper could you look into what _Mediterranean Progeny_ is for me please?
25/01/2021, 17:56 - Lockers: A Mediterranean prodigy?

25/01/2021, 18:04 - Paul: How do you like your eggs in the morning? I like mine with a peg
25/01/2021, 18:04 - James: Eggs or legs?
25/01/2021, 18:04 - Paul: I'm satisfied as long as I get my peg
25/01/2021, 18:05 - Wezz: Seems like the eggs are irrelevant?
25/01/2021, 18:05 - Paul: So uncultured
25/01/2021, 18:06 - Wezz: I get the reference lol, swapping for legs is just a large deviation from the source material.
25/01/2021, 18:07 - Wezz: It was like, the 60's. Pretty sure if she said "eggs or legs"? He'd backhand her
25/01/2021, 18:09 - Lockers: Rightfully so am I right???
25/01/2021, 18:11 - Wezz: https://youtu.be/l0YmmSxLeH8?t=111

25/01/2021, 18:13 - Paul: No I meant uncultured to egg/leg pegging society
25/01/2021, 18:14 - James: He just doesn't get it Paul
25/01/2021, 18:14 - James: Classic pleggian
25/01/2021, 18:15 - Wezz: Why does everyone call me a pleggian?! Every where I go
25/01/2021, 18:15 - Wezz: _I just don't understand_
25/01/2021, 18:44 - Qck: Piper can you find out what the fuck a Mediterranean Pleggian is before I lose my shit
25/01/2021, 18:57 - Noone: this song used to play before the terry wogan show on raido before school

26/01/2021, 12:27 - Noone: Feel guilty for laughing at him now, he was mentally unstable this entire time
26/01/2021, 12:28 - Paul: I don't think you were meant to laugh at him
26/01/2021, 12:29 - Qck: You realise that you're the most likely of us all to go genderqueer right?

26/01/2021, 13:29 - Wezz: Did not know Joe Goes was now a lady... he was always jumping on the latest fad.
26/01/2021, 13:31 - Noone: Joe Goes: Off the deep end
26/01/2021, 13:33 - Wezz: Strikingly common for those who live by the social media sword. Soon as they drop in numbers they lose their identity and cling on to any fringe group that will pay attention.

Wow I'm a pessimistic asshole.
26/01/2021, 13:35 - Paul: I think it's more of a group psychology phenomenon. They are searching for an identity sure, but i don't think it's done in a sinister way to garner more attention, I think that that's more of a symptom of the growing trend of identity crises in the digital world and poorly managing that
26/01/2021, 13:37 - Wezz: I agree with you. But wouldn't underestimate the sense of affirmation that social media numbers give individuals in the modern age. Particularly those searching for belonging.
26/01/2021, 13:38 - Paul: Oh for sure, I mean we've seen higher ups at Facebook admitting to seeking that addictive formula
26/01/2021, 13:39 - Wezz: Corporations for ¬£¬£ vs individuals for self worth. Latter is addressable through mental health, just cure them all already Paul.
26/01/2021, 13:40 - Paul: Still would love to see a case study on the speed running community funded
26/01/2021, 13:40 - Paul: Fuck capitalism amirite
26/01/2021, 13:41 - Wezz: Stop taking selfies in the snow and solidify these gender fluid, responsibility-fleeing clowns.
26/01/2021, 13:41 - Paul: This is now a socialist group chat guys Spider-Man memes only
26/01/2021, 13:41 - Paul: That shits above my pay grade
26/01/2021, 13:43 - Wezz: I was trying to make some kinda:
Water -> Snow.
Gender Fluid -> Societal solidarity reference.

Not smart enough unfortunately..
26/01/2021, 13:43 - Paul: Yeah I totally missed that one lol
26/01/2021, 13:44 - Wezz: Surprised you're not in academia with all those socialist views.... ohwait
26/01/2021, 13:44 - Paul: I'm brainwashed by my *checks notes* professor of visual attention

26/01/2021, 13:51 - Wezz: I learnt this from a Libertines song when I was 15 (probably wasn't paying attention in history). Your sister gave me a copy of their new album. Pretty nice call back
26/01/2021, 13:51 - Paul: Rachel?
26/01/2021, 13:51 - Wezz: Yeah I think so!
26/01/2021, 13:52 - Paul: Lol wtf
26/01/2021, 13:52 - Wezz: One of your relatives
26/01/2021, 13:52 - Wezz: Album wasn't released yet, I was torrenting it on a 56k modem and was taking a week. She had a copy already burnt and gave me it
26/01/2021, 13:52 - Wezz: #neverforgetti
26/01/2021, 13:52 - Paul: That's so random
26/01/2021, 13:53 - Wezz: Also we played chubby bunny with cocktail sausages... oh the times have changed
26/01/2021, 13:53 - Paul: Are you sure this wasn't a fever dream
26/01/2021, 13:54 - Wezz: Was your 16th birthday? I'd guess?
26/01/2021, 13:54 - Paul: I did have one of those so that checks out
26/01/2021, 13:54 - Paul: You're too I imagine
26/01/2021, 13:54 - Paul: Yours*
26/01/2021, 13:54 - Paul: Wait so you weren't 15. Busted

26/01/2021, 13:55 - Paul: Miss that house
26/01/2021, 13:55 - Wezz: Food was in the living room area, kitchen joins to your back room.
26/01/2021, 13:55 - Wezz: Stereo was in the living room
26/01/2021, 13:55 - Nathan: Wireless LAN meet ups üò≠üò≠

26/01/2021, 13:56 - Nathan: Tomato tomatto
26/01/2021, 13:57 - Paul: It's all boring now. They don't close the street and allow crowds anymore
26/01/2021, 14:03 - Nathan: Why they do this! Folk week was so good!
26/01/2021, 14:04 - Paul: Under age kids getting fights and scaring the folky crowd mostly
26/01/2021, 14:10 - Lockers: Who cares about under age kids at folk week right??
26/01/2021, 14:18 - Dayle: After covid dies down we can all go to a villa in Spain now we are adults haha

27/01/2021, 11:58 - Qck: Did anyone put money on $GME?
27/01/2021, 11:59 - Qck: Was laughing yesterday at some guy's misfortune getting on the gamestop train at 120 dollars, pretty sure it closed somewhere near 160
27/01/2021, 11:59 - Mike: I do enough roulette on the weekends
27/01/2021, 11:59 - Qck: Also cost short stock big wallstreet bettors billions so far
27/01/2021, 12:00 - Qck: Just funny to me that one subreddit has just cost big investors sooooo much money
27/01/2021, 12:00 - Mike: Power of morons in herds, it's going to be attempted every week now. blackberry and blockbuster next right?
27/01/2021, 12:01 - Qck: Yeah that's right, well hats off to the morons who subscribe to that subreddit who got on when they were trading for 7 bucks a share
27/01/2021, 12:02 - Mike: Yeh no doubt, same as the early coiners who got their lambos
27/01/2021, 12:03 - Qck: Coin always surprises me that it's still an insanely worthwhile if volatile investment option
27/01/2021, 12:04 - Qck: By the way if anyone wants more financial advice it will cost you a copy of zelda: breath of the wild, I know you have a copy Derek
27/01/2021, 12:06 - Mike: If you pick one of the winning coins and don't get stuck with PaulCoin
27/01/2021, 12:08 - Mike: Btw Mike Coin is criminally undervalued right now, buy and hold
27/01/2021, 12:09 - Qck: Yeah discounting alt coins, but provided you didn't get on the tippy top of shits like ethereum you would have made super worthwhile gains
27/01/2021, 12:10 - Qck: All of my Mike Coin is stuck in a harddrive in a landfill site in Wales, wish me luck
27/01/2021, 12:11 - Mike: Is what wsb doing legal? Can individuals conspire specifically to make money from short holders? Seems like a grey area of market manipulation to me but I don't have a clue
27/01/2021, 12:13 - Qck: I'm sure there's an expert somewhere on reddit who will tell you exactly what laws they could be breaking but from my understanding it's perfectly legal due to the nature of what wsb is (message board for stock enthusiautists)
27/01/2021, 12:15 - Paul: The OG guy who wrote threads about it is now a multimillionaire
27/01/2021, 12:15 - Qck: And also the inevitable dump of stocks will be the closest we get to a mortal kombat fatality to a business
27/01/2021, 12:16 - Qck: Ryan Cohen was the dude who really cashed in as he picked up a 13% stakehold at 3.25 a share lmao
27/01/2021, 12:16 - Mike: Can't wait to read his book
27/01/2021, 12:16 - Paul: Yeah I saw that. Now he's on the board and making crazy changes
27/01/2021, 12:17 - Mike: Yeh I wonder if the use of technology here will be the crucial grey spot, no direct messages between the complicit
27/01/2021, 12:21 - Wezz: Found this to be really interesting ready. He's bringing in previous business partners etc. Prob all false hope to leverage but interesting nonetheless.
27/01/2021, 12:21 - Qck: I just dunno if a bunch of people getting hyped on a movement (let's make money on gamestop) as opposed to maliciously pump and dumping via organisational malevolence (let's artificially inflate the stock price so we can sell later when others buy in)
27/01/2021, 12:21 - Qck: You'd have to improve intent for the latter even if both of them end with the same result for the stock
27/01/2021, 12:22 - Qck: I don't think the average reddit squib cares about whatever big wallstreet bettor is shorting the stock either
27/01/2021, 12:26 - Mike: Gonna be some massive pivot to something else, GameStop become solar panel makers
27/01/2021, 12:26 - Qck: Yeah in anticipation for this fsb downgraded blackberry's stock in hopes of deterring people buying in
27/01/2021, 12:27 - Qck: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/blackberry-stock-rockets-again-as-company-says-it-is-not-aware-of-reason-for-recent-trading-activity-2021-01-25
27/01/2021, 12:27 - Mike: Yeh logically sounds similar but feel like something will be brought to bear on this, lots of rich people losing money generally means that
27/01/2021, 12:29 - Qck: If it means every redditor in America getting guillotined in Joe Biden's communist USSA then fine by me
27/01/2021, 12:29 - Qck: -in America; it's early
27/01/2021, 12:30 - Mike: Like any large crime they'll just get a few leaders to make examples of but yeh I get you

27/01/2021, 23:02 - Dayle: <Media omitted>
27/01/2021, 23:02 - Paul: Swear he didn't even inhale it properly
27/01/2021, 23:02 - Lockers: Haha spilling beans
27/01/2021, 23:02 - Paul: And Dayle hates beans
27/01/2021, 23:02 - Dayle: the billionaire that is bringing commercial space travel to millions you fucking benchord
27/01/2021, 23:02 - Wezz: Great little documentary
27/01/2021, 23:03 - Mike: as long as the pyramids get built yaya
27/01/2021, 23:03 - Paul: While his workers can't afford an ambulance or they die
27/01/2021, 23:03 - Dayle: dont live in a non health care country then
27/01/2021, 23:03 - Dayle: same shit right - workers work for living
27/01/2021, 23:04 - Dayle: but they are not changing the face of this planets future
27/01/2021, 23:04 - Paul: He wouldn't have the same success anywhere else because they'd be allowed a union
27/01/2021, 23:05 - Dayle: they are the pinnacle of the future for us - i sacrifice the same for future generations
27/01/2021, 23:05 - Dayle: null argument - what side are you arguing?
27/01/2021, 23:05 - Lockers: You do?
27/01/2021, 23:06 - Wezz: Do you think people think he's cool or something? He's literally the biggest autist in the world
27/01/2021, 23:06 - Dayle: I would yeah - i sacrifice my mental health for improving health care for millions in the UK same as wezz - same as kirky he is giving up his body for post
27/01/2021, 23:07 - Paul: While Elon buys his 50th yacht and gives you a thumbs up
27/01/2021, 23:07 - Dayle: everyone gives up something in vein of what they have to do, but elon is bringing the future to the human race
27/01/2021, 23:07 - Dayle: bin yourself :D
27/01/2021, 23:09 - Dayle: he also pledged 100m for the first person to create carbon filters
27/01/2021, 23:09 - Dayle: what would you do with the money :D
27/01/2021, 23:09 - Wezz: Not sure why he gets exaggerated hate, the majority of his companies are focused on pretty eco friendly ideas. He cherry picked cause of his company's worth, which is not based on sales but on his REVOLUTIONARY products. I get the hatred for employee benefits but take that shit to most fortune 500s and drop the bias.
27/01/2021, 23:10 - Dayle: yeyeyeyeye we can argue on mars
27/01/2021, 23:10 - Paul: I'd say the same about any billionaire
27/01/2021, 23:10 - Dayle: warren buffet - ok go
27/01/2021, 23:10 - Wezz: Sure, but Elon actually has some redeeming qualities
27/01/2021, 23:10 - Wezz: Not him, but the companies etc.
27/01/2021, 23:11 - Lockers: Piper - ok go
27/01/2021, 23:11 - Paul: Why would you respect people who hoard wealth as if it were something to be proud of
27/01/2021, 23:12 - Mike: Here it goes again - Ok go
27/01/2021, 23:12 - Dayle: 3 companies that elon has and what are they doing

SpaceX - improving space travel for everyone
Tesla - bringing carbon 0 cars and the ability to reduce our future generations emissions
Boring - Enabling underground travel to reduce travel footprint
27/01/2021, 23:12 - Paul: You can respect space X any their achievements, but it would still be better suited as a state function
27/01/2021, 23:12 - Dayle: GET IN THE BIN - did you drink milk paul today well your killing the planet bud
27/01/2021, 23:12 - Wezz: The state failed for decades
27/01/2021, 23:13 - Dayle: fucking hell people don't understand sacrifice to progression today
27/01/2021, 23:13 - Paul: Yes because the problem is that the state is designed around privatisation
27/01/2021, 23:13 - Wezz: I don't get this, hating on the new wave actually benefitting the future generations. Instead of the competition stifling existing billionaires. Totally misplaced imo
27/01/2021, 23:13 - Dayle: i didnt i was stating a billionaire that should be stopped
27/01/2021, 23:14 - Dayle: name one person doing better for our future than elon.. go ill wait
27/01/2021, 23:14 - Wezz: Yeah, they incentivise private work in areas that benefit the people. E.g. emissions
27/01/2021, 23:14 - Dayle: paul - work in private and change the world. If you die on this hill for your life you wont make a mark :)
27/01/2021, 23:16 - Mike: Probably because you can realise that a person isn't wholly bad or good, some kind of shite of grey
27/01/2021, 23:16 - Wezz: And then he gets front of the queue flamed for making meaningful developments. I don't disagree this SHOULD be state funded. But it *isn't*. So get off the jealous high horse and give credit where it's due. So bored of that media repeated nonsense. Bloody got people on the space station with NASA only few months ago. Making biggest leaps in space travel since moon landing
27/01/2021, 23:17 - Mike: Koch family has got a lot of foundations too, probably worth a parade that
27/01/2021, 23:18 - Lockers: Wtf no I'm white as white can be
27/01/2021, 23:18 - Derren: I loved seeing the guy comment Robin hood
27/01/2021, 23:18 - Derren: üòÇüòÇ
27/01/2021, 23:18 - Dayle: But when coming to state mandated health care is not elons problem essentially - just because we live in the UK with free health care 95% of the world doesnt have that luxury and we should state the fact of that its not down to the CEO of a company as they are multi conglomerate so regional laws a null in there eyes they have bigger problems
27/01/2021, 23:20 - Paul: The ambulance bit was tongue in cheek to suggest they are violently under paid and have shitty insurance because of Elons illegal antiunion policies
27/01/2021, 23:20 - Dayle: I have people or friends in the UK that are under paid the minimum wage - Just saying
27/01/2021, 23:21 - Paul: And that's also shit I never put this all on Elon Musk
27/01/2021, 23:21 - Mike: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab_mentality
27/01/2021, 23:21 - Wezz: It's 100% grey. And it's not just about Elon either. Just all these media outlets comparing individuals and searching for corruption to poison the good. Need some nuance in the 1% hatred, read about Starlink vs Amazon if you want to understand more
27/01/2021, 23:21 - Dayle: go fuck jeff bozo - because he is the real slave driver billionaire that is doing fuck all apart from making money
27/01/2021, 23:22 - Wezz: https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/l5grv4/elon_musk_blasts_jeff_bezos_amazon_for_attempting/
27/01/2021, 23:23 - Paul: I never meant to single out Elon here I'm just not a fan of Smaug like capitalists under paying their workers and lobbying for stopping them unionising all the while putting out a few donations and keeping up a fancy PR act
27/01/2021, 23:23 - Paul: I like spaceX it's cool and I've followed and supported NASA for like 20 years so don't act like I'm anti progressive
27/01/2021, 23:24 - Dayle: If we are getting on to billionaires to hate what about mark zuck that is actually opening silencing free speech?
27/01/2021, 23:24 - Mike: No
27/01/2021, 23:24 - Wezz: Totally, and that's a valid issue that should be resolved. I'll ride Elon's autistic cock until I die. He's a vulnerable, mentally challenged, unique thinker that will benefit generations way after our time. Same way slave owners used slaves back in the day, he uses union loop holes. It's not him signing the shit himself let's be real, he's an Engineer.
27/01/2021, 23:25 - Dayle: "I'll ride Elon's autistic cock until I die" ---- sign me up!!
27/01/2021, 23:25 - Paul: Do you think I like Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos?
27/01/2021, 23:25 - Wezz: As the famous slogan goes;
Don't hate the player, hate the game.
27/01/2021, 23:25 - Dayle: Ill do LSD with him
27/01/2021, 23:25 - Wezz: Also don't hate on elon or i'll post 10 messages again
27/01/2021, 23:25 - Wezz: at least hate on 10 other billionaires first. Then I'll allow it
27/01/2021, 23:25 - Dayle: I found out today i love elon - get on my cock :D
27/01/2021, 23:26 - Paul: He's the first in the guillotine come the revolution though. But that's literally because we're organising it by net worth
27/01/2021, 23:27 - Wezz: If so, you should see the good in his efforts in supporting SpaceX. Sub to the SpaceX reddit, it's sick and they don't talk shit politics
27/01/2021, 23:27 - Dayle: elon early company x.com merged to create paypal
27/01/2021, 23:27 - Dayle: mention another technological advancement he has done?
27/01/2021, 23:27 - Dayle: ill fight any cunt for elon
27/01/2021, 23:27 - Dayle: ill get his tattoo
27/01/2021, 23:29 - Wezz: An important distinction, is that his worth is based on ideas and potential worth, as opposed to actual cash flow e.g. almost every company in Fortune 500.
27/01/2021, 23:29 - Wezz: I think that means he should get the lethal injection or something
27/01/2021, 23:29 - Lockers: Guys it's bedtime go to bed
27/01/2021, 23:29 - Wezz: We can figure that out later
27/01/2021, 23:29 - Paul: Jack just skipped the queues he's first
27/01/2021, 23:30 - Nathan: For once I agree with Jack 2 ü§£
27/01/2021, 23:30 - Lockers: ????? I'm Jack 1
27/01/2021, 23:31 - Nathan: Nonono I'm sure we've been over this before. Jack No One
27/01/2021, 23:31 - Qck: Top kek
27/01/2021, 23:32 - Lockers: Thia cuts deep and you know that
27/01/2021, 23:32 - Wezz: I mean... this is a weird thing to say too. We're comparing him to US companies with same regulations. He would be top of any country he was in - the guy has had some incredible ideas and it's a shame you don't think so. Obv I love Bill Gates more but swings and roundabouts.
27/01/2021, 23:33 - Lockers: Paul isn't it like 3am over there? Let wezz have this one man
27/01/2021, 23:34 - Wezz: And of course he should be held accountable for his staff health care etc. That's a bigger national issue and should be treated as such.
27/01/2021, 23:34 - Wezz: Anyway
27/01/2021, 23:34 - Qck: Elon can suck my fat nuts
27/01/2021, 23:34 - Paul: His anti union efforts are criminal even until US law. But that shit would be bitchslapped and sanctioned in the EU. He can lobby for it in the US
27/01/2021, 23:34 - Paul: Under*
27/01/2021, 23:34 - Qck: Isn't he the face of tesla when they want to show that their cars aren't sledgehammer proof
27/01/2021, 23:35 - Wezz: Lolz
27/01/2021, 23:35 - Qck: A bit like Steve Jobs when he came out and said he was cancer proof
27/01/2021, 23:35 - Paul: That video was hilarious tbf
27/01/2021, 23:35 - Wezz: He has a 20 min video where he's trying to explain how the sledgehammer incident happened. It's just full-on autism. Get to see his engineering brain in panic mode
27/01/2021, 23:36 - Qck: Elon Musk just juggles migraines left by having too many kids, his Twitter account and his mate jim's texts when come on jim i already did the flamethrower thing stop texting me your wacky ideas
27/01/2021, 23:36 - Wezz: Not even touched on Neuralink..
27/01/2021, 23:37 - Wezz: Save that for a rainy day
27/01/2021, 23:37 - Mike: Not even enough processor left to name his kids
27/01/2021, 23:37 - Mike: <Media omitted>
27/01/2021, 23:37 - Paul: Fuck that was some low hanging fruit I totally forgot
27/01/2021, 23:38 - Wezz: We legit implant DBS stimulators at work.. it's a thing
27/01/2021, 23:38 - Wezz: He's doing a close loop version, we have one of those for SCS already (Stimwave).
27/01/2021, 23:38 - Wezz: Literally in my research field
27/01/2021, 23:38 - Wezz: Elon tucks me in at night.
27/01/2021, 23:39 - Paul: Last I checked the adverts were claiming a whole lot more than DBS
27/01/2021, 23:39 - Lockers: DBS/SCS @447561062944?
27/01/2021, 23:39 - Paul: But that was a while ago
27/01/2021, 23:39 - Paul: Deep brain stim
27/01/2021, 23:39 - Paul: Used in neurological disorders such as Parkinson's or epilepsy
27/01/2021, 23:40 - Lockers: Wtf do you know I asked wezz
27/01/2021, 23:40 - Derren: Isn't DBS a criminal check assessment
27/01/2021, 23:40 - Wezz: Yeah, there was marketing spin for sure. And obviously, his 'crazy professor' fans ran with it which didn't help media outlash. But w/e, he's published and has studies underway.
27/01/2021, 23:40 - Wezz: yes
27/01/2021, 23:40 - Derren: ü§≠
27/01/2021, 23:40 - Lockers: Classic Derek
27/01/2021, 23:40 - Qck: Derek!
27/01/2021, 23:40 - Qck: Send me a copy of breath of the wild brother
27/01/2021, 23:40 - Derren: Guys, it's midnight and you all have work tomorrow
27/01/2021, 23:40 - Lockers: Wow now I'll never know what SCS means thanks wezz
27/01/2021, 23:40 - Qck: I know you have it
27/01/2021, 23:41 - Wezz: Spinal cord stimulation
27/01/2021, 23:41 - Lockers: I've tried this dude
27/01/2021, 23:41 - Derren: Stop this bs and go to sleep
27/01/2021, 23:41 - Lockers: My life is complete
27/01/2021, 23:41 - Derren: We are not making any difference to this world, we will all die cold and alone
27/01/2021, 23:41 - Derren: Good night
27/01/2021, 23:41 - Derren: Love you all
27/01/2021, 23:42 - Wezz: Might die on the Moon if Elon gets his finger out..
27/01/2021, 23:42 - Qck: You're not that's for sure you aion fuck
27/01/2021, 23:42 - Derren: I don't have a switch anymore, brother lost it with all my games
27/01/2021, 23:42 - Wezz: Classic DBS Derek
27/01/2021, 23:42 - Qck: Devastated, feel free to buy me it then to make up for your brother
27/01/2021, 23:43 - Derren: Who are you anyway
27/01/2021, 23:43 - Derren: Qck?
27/01/2021, 23:44 - Wezz: It's Elon you uncultured swine! Buy him breath of the wild !
27/01/2021, 23:44 - Qck: I'm your dad Derek, now eat your kabob and stop playing your faggot games
27/01/2021, 23:44 - Derren: Kebab is not a good idea this time of night on a school week
27/01/2021, 23:44 - Derren: Night *
27/01/2021, 23:45 - Qck: If you're telling Dayle that Turks don't eat a kebab a night then you might as well tell him that Father Claus is made up and ruin Christmas as well
27/01/2021, 23:46 - Derren: Who is eating a full meal at midnight on a school night
27/01/2021, 23:46 - Derren: Crazy white people
27/01/2021, 23:47 - Derren: https://youtu.be/dHFFe4p0Iuc just listen to this to cheer you up and then emulate botw on pc
27/01/2021, 23:49 - Paul: Policeman confirmed you were white I'll never forget
27/01/2021, 23:49 - Derren: I will also never forget
27/01/2021, 23:49 - Mike: also confirmed nigger was a racial slur and not a swear
27/01/2021, 23:49 - Derren: #lestweforget
27/01/2021, 23:50 - Dayle: @447588936693 kebabs are you blood brother im funding your life :D
27/01/2021, 23:50 - Derren: üëÄ
27/01/2021, 23:50 - Paul: No I think he settled the argument that dickhead was a swear word.
27/01/2021, 23:50 - Lockers: <Media omitted>
27/01/2021, 23:50 - Derren: Police men are wankers anyway
27/01/2021, 23:50 - Derren: Fuck the govt
27/01/2021, 23:51 - Dayle: @447561062944 we can drive off in teslas into the horizon with our healthcare system omegalul
27/01/2021, 23:51 - Paul: Check out this badass
27/01/2021, 23:51 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
27/01/2021, 23:51 - Derren: Mate
27/01/2021, 23:52 - Derren: Oot intro brings me true nostalgia
27/01/2021, 23:52 - Derren: And the spirit temple is probably my fav song in any game
27/01/2021, 23:52 - Dayle: we wont have any wild breathe if elon wasn't about @447835575116
27/01/2021, 23:53 - Derren: But the wind wanker intro is top tier
27/01/2021, 23:53 - Wezz: I'll never afford a Tesla through this crippling capitalism üòü
27/01/2021, 23:53 - Dayle: hope your brain magic can make us breath (CO)
27/01/2021, 23:54 - Dayle: I work in private when i make it ill buy you one mate dont worry :D
27/01/2021, 23:54 - Mike: your body will provide much needed mulch for the Tesla employee's lunch though
27/01/2021, 23:55 - Paul: Lmao
27/01/2021, 23:55 - Derren: <Media omitted>
27/01/2021, 23:55 - Mike: dayle after 3 shandys*
27/01/2021, 23:55 - Dayle: wont be long boys - the dumb cunt from no where haha :D
27/01/2021, 23:55 - Derren: üòÇ
27/01/2021, 23:55 - Dayle: 0 GCSEs lets go hot tubs? :D
27/01/2021, 23:56 - Wezz: Defo not a Tesla employee, prob a waitress or the countless other under supported professions in the US LOL
27/01/2021, 23:56 - Wezz: at least I hope so
27/01/2021, 23:56 - Paul: Is this you criticising how valuable your mulch is
27/01/2021, 23:56 - Mike: They just need to bring in tips for everyone, that'll sort it. Can't wait to tip the president
27/01/2021, 23:56 - Wezz: I'll give Elon my tip üòâüòâ
27/01/2021, 23:59 - Mike: Biden started another war? Definitely a 5% tip, show him how upset I am
27/01/2021, 23:59 - Mike: Can't go any lower, he needs to feed his wife and kids
28/01/2021, 00:04 - Dayle: all i know is im a challenger rank ashe in bronze so anything i say is invalid
28/01/2021, 00:05 - Dayle: its like being bruce lee selling cakes
28/01/2021, 00:07 - Wezz: One day we'll move away from simplistic view of blaming individuals for the inadequacies of a humongous complex system.

It's not Elon's fault Julie at the bakery gets below minimum wage. The same way it's not just Trump's fault that your neighbors a racist prick.

There's a series of complex events, including your own impact on the world (e.g. buying your shit 60p bread from Iceland Wezz) that stifles competition and crushes Julie's minimum wage bakery dreams.
28/01/2021, 00:08 - Wezz: I'm going to bed listening to OOT soundtrack, thanks Misto
28/01/2021, 00:10 - Mike: Sounds like communism to me, Red Wezz they call him
28/01/2021, 00:12 - Paul: The world‚Äôs 2,153 billionaires have more wealth than the 4.6 billion people who make up 60 percent of the planet‚Äôs population
28/01/2021, 00:13 - Paul: System is broken lads let's have a tea
28/01/2021, 00:15 - Mike: invest in GME*
28/01/2021, 00:16 - Wezz: Take back from the Hedgehogs üí∞üí∞
28/01/2021, 00:17 - Wezz: Yeah it's fucked. I just bought my shopping from Amazon cause they gave me ¬£10 off üëåWOOP fml
28/01/2021, 00:18 - Paul: Did you use a code from Derek this time
28/01/2021, 00:21 - Wezz: Don't think he's ever given me a code that's worked.. just false hope.
28/01/2021, 00:22 - Wezz: Still haven't tried the McD's Katsu Nuggets ü•∫
28/01/2021, 00:25 - Mike: Preferred the original myself
28/01/2021, 00:27 - Wezz: Hard to improve on the OGs
28/01/2021, 00:38 - Mike: Wsb sub banned? Boy oh boy
28/01/2021, 00:39 - Mike: Oh no just gone private
28/01/2021, 08:31 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
28/01/2021, 08:32 - Paul: This should be a PSA
28/01/2021, 08:54 - Derren: Op soundtrack
28/01/2021, 09:12 - Paul: <Media omitted>
28/01/2021, 09:21 - James: Oh fuck you, I literally just saw that and was ready to post as you did haha
28/01/2021, 09:25 - Wezz: Lol reference to old wsb autists HODL TSLA
28/01/2021, 09:26 - Paul: Wezz I'd love to see some of this neuralink research you mentioned any links?
28/01/2021, 09:28 - Wezz: Let's talk outside the group üëå
28/01/2021, 09:32 - Kirky: Why you whispering bro
28/01/2021, 09:35 - Paul: He's right it's top secret sorry
28/01/2021, 09:36 - Nathan: Wait is this based on research of people within the group? Is that why you can't tell us! üò±
28/01/2021, 09:36 - Nathan: Drugged us and probed our minds
28/01/2021, 09:36 - Paul: This whole chat is a psychological experiment I'm running
28/01/2021, 09:48 - Lockers: Woah nah Neuralink is something that everyone could be interested in
28/01/2021, 09:48 - Lockers: We get it you go to uni#
28/01/2021, 09:57 - Kirky: I honestly don't know if I'd be surprised
28/01/2021, 12:11 - Wezz: We've cracked the code, Paul's going to start playing League
28/01/2021, 12:12 - Paul: It's a case study of the descent into madness through league of legends abuse
28/01/2021, 12:19 - Wezz: COVID + Alcohol are big confounders
28/01/2021, 12:21 - Mike: <Media omitted>
28/01/2021, 12:21 - Wezz: I LOVE WORKING ITS GREAT
28/01/2021, 12:21 - Mike: What's work
28/01/2021, 12:23 - Paul: Those are independent variables. The non alcoholics are the control
28/01/2021, 12:33 - Wezz: Find me a non-alcoholic during lockdown and I'll find you a liar
28/01/2021, 12:33 - Wezz: ..Derek doesn't count
28/01/2021, 12:35 - Paul: This is why studies on non-porn watchers are so scarce
28/01/2021, 12:45 - Wezz: I wrote a response to this on the loo:
1. I completely agree this needs addressing
2. To understand why this is happening can search for the pareto distribution, prices law, etc.
3. JP does a really good job explaining this here, well worth watching:
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=U6gwiN_Aqg4

Again, it's me agreeing but trying to provide some further context rather than just hating rich people (lol).
28/01/2021, 12:47 - Paul: One of the biggest issues is these people convincing everyone that their value is greater than the sum of their contributions which is the main issue of unchecked capitalism. The surplus isn't used for the production but for more capital
28/01/2021, 12:47 - Paul: But we don't have to get into this again lol
28/01/2021, 12:48 - Mike: Just tell me who's heads need to roll already, my torch is going out
28/01/2021, 12:49 - Wezz: I agree, however that's literally the Pareto distribution. And same thing would happen if we all had ¬£10 and played heads or tails for ¬£1 50:50. Would go normal distribution to Pareto to 1 person with all the wealth. If we shovel money to the bottom it goes back to the top. Agree it's a massive problem. Watch the vid as it just provides further context.
28/01/2021, 12:52 - Paul: Not sure I follow the heads or tails logic
28/01/2021, 12:57 - Lockers: When you flip a coin, it has got 2 sides; heads and tails
28/01/2021, 13:00 - Derren: <Media omitted>

28/01/2021, 13:09 - Lockers: ps you're in
28/01/2021, 13:09 - Mike: Like I'd join a group that would let the likes of me in
28/01/2021, 13:11 - Wezz: "I wouldn't want to belong to a club that would have me as a member" - Groucho Marx
28/01/2021, 13:12 - Mike: What had him so grouchy? Communism?
28/01/2021, 13:12 - Paul: Clickbait of the title aside, he didn't offer any solution, he said its a difficult question, "put your own house in order and use your money wisely" was his conclusive statement. He says its a hierarchical issue, not a capitalist issue, and then criticised Marxism because people have an inherent hierarchical tier due to their contributions. That's just a fundamental misunderstanding of Marxism and its goals. He seems to be under the impression that due to hierarchical structuring, you can't fault capitalism. Well then why doesn't he support the complete overhaul of the regulation of capitalism? He could support workplace democracy, where there is a structural hierarchy, but its capped based on specified tiers, he could support the disregulation of lobbying, or 100 other non-marxist ideas that could mediate the growing inequality. It's not about hating on rich people, it's about accepting the fact that capitalism (especially unabashed, unregulated capitalism like in the west) fosters an environment where this inequality will prosper and grow. We should be starting with worker co-ops at a minimum, establishing strong workplace unions, and being hardline on tax breaks for the rich
28/01/2021, 13:12 - Mike: Also it's been 2 days since they received my aids test and no reply
28/01/2021, 13:13 - Paul: And also hating the rich as a side hobby
28/01/2021, 13:16 - Dayle: Yikes already dead bro
28/01/2021, 13:27 - Lockers: Pretty much guarantees you've got it, takes longer to process and double check
28/01/2021, 13:28 - Mike: Heavier if it's positive, takes kirky longer to carry
28/01/2021, 13:29 - Lockers: @447757709019 how do the "Priority" postboxes work?
28/01/2021, 13:29 - Lockers: like I don't get why they're quicker
28/01/2021, 13:30 - Paul: Maybe they are prioritised
28/01/2021, 13:31 - Kirky: Pretty much
28/01/2021, 13:32 - Paul: nailed it
28/01/2021, 13:32 - Kirky: Always emptied at last pickup. Some boxes get emptied once a day from 9am onwards, priority are emptied at 5pm I think
28/01/2021, 13:32 - Lockers: Ah ok thanks Paul, hey look at us helping each other out today
28/01/2021, 13:32 - Kirky: Also emptied on sundays now
28/01/2021, 13:33 - Paul: Even the biggest of enemies can put their differences aside for the greater good comrade

28/01/2021, 13:44 - Dayle: laughed more than i should have tbbh
28/01/2021, 13:44 - Wezz: Funniest thing, cause if I hadn't watched the video I would just completely agree with you. But since I've actually watched it. I know you've just strawmanned a whole arguement. He's pro union in other vids (to an extent). In this one he is literally just talking about wealth distribution and how the Pareto distribution is not unique to capitalism. He also fundamentally agrees with what we say.

And he obv doesn't name the YouTube vids... Lol
28/01/2021, 13:51 - Paul: What did I strawman?
28/01/2021, 13:56 - Paul: He was asked a few times, and as the title implied, to discuss ways to solve the growing inequality, he didn't remotely do that. He just tried to reframe the issue into a different semantic argument. I didn't know he's pro union, as he never discussed it in the video discussing ways to solve inequality. It felt like a lot of pseudointellectual waffle tbh. He said very minimal stuff of substance
28/01/2021, 13:57 - Wezz: Totally agree he didn't offer any solutions
28/01/2021, 13:57 - Wezz: Video titled garbage.
28/01/2021, 13:59 - Paul: I dunno if it was though, I felt like the interviewer wanted to discuss that topic
28/01/2021, 14:00 - Nathan: Fuck me the plate weights. Guys face is now gone
28/01/2021, 14:01 - Wezz: Oh sure, we all want the answer. Peterson is smart, but not smart enough to solve that monstrosity. That's his point.
28/01/2021, 14:01 - Dayle: :D
28/01/2021, 14:01 - Paul: Yeah that one hurt to watch jesus
28/01/2021, 14:01 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
28/01/2021, 14:02 - Wezz: Also sorry, was in a meeting. Video for the coin distribution ^
28/01/2021, 14:08 - Wezz: In this model, Dm=$1 has the same value for all transactions.  To speed up convergence, each agent is initially given the smaller amount $10.  The simulations are performed with 500 agents and repeated 1000 times.  The histogram shown in the animation is obtained by adding the histograms of all runs.  Because Dm is small, the money distribution evolves in a diffusive manner.  The initial distribution first broadens into a symmetric, Gaussian curve.   Then, probability starts to accumulate around m=0, which acts as the impenetrable boundary, because money balances of agents cannot go below zero. As a result, the probability distribution acquires a skewed (asymmetric) exponential shape.

Whole point of this demonstration is that if we all start with *equal sums*, and play a *50:50 game* with each other, we get a pareto distribution (what we currently have with wealth distribution).

It's not unique to capitalism, corruption that occurs within any society ofc makes it worse; money = power etc. Hence why we need to remedy this, that's the end of his message. I think it provides a different message than 'fuck the rich' which is so simplistically _wrong_.
28/01/2021, 14:10 - Wezz: If you continue the model, of people heads or tails'ing forever. Then ONE person ends up with all the money. Of course in society, when enough of the population are dispossessed we get riots. So we need to act earlier. Which is in agreement with everything we discussed.
28/01/2021, 14:13 - Wezz: Lol can go private with this maybe too. I know we agree - we have the same answer, just trying to (badly?) explain my different perspective.
28/01/2021, 14:14 - Lockers: Jesus why don't you just fuck already
28/01/2021, 14:25 - Wezz: "He seems to be under the impression that due to hierarchical structuring, you can't fault capitalism."
He specifically says all hierarchies are destined for corruption. He regularly talks about faults of capitalism, has hours of lectures on proposals. Most of what you said after this sentence was not related to what was discussed in the video, nevertheless I agree with it. ü•∏
28/01/2021, 14:54 - Dayle: i fancy an ice cream
28/01/2021, 14:56 - Paul: Doesn't think break if you can go below 0 though? It just forms a normal Gaussian around 0.1 or something
28/01/2021, 14:57 - Paul: And we know that people can rack up debt in real life
28/01/2021, 14:58 - Paul: I meant more "he seems to be under the impression that due to hierarchical structuring, you can't blame capitalism for inequality". Rather than implying he thought you can't fault capitalism
28/01/2021, 14:58 - Lockers: *peasants
28/01/2021, 15:01 - Paul: Also, I dunno how much this concept holds outside of wealth. Marxism is more concerned with power inequality which is propagated by wealth. I dunno if models would show the same thing if you eliminated money, and instead substituted production value as the "currency".
28/01/2021, 15:09 - Paul: Plus ultimately, we can both look at that animated graph and consider a few simple rule changes that would result in it working more fairly. Currently under capitalism, it is like that graph, but even worse. I don't think its an inevitable result of economics at all, in this argument it only serves to act like a reason we shouldn't try. Which seems counter to your actual stance
28/01/2021, 15:14 - Wezz: The point is that, even with complete fair 50:50 trades over time it leads to a pareto distribution. That makes sense to you right?
28/01/2021, 15:14 - Wezz: And over even more time it leads to one person owning all the money.
28/01/2021, 15:15 - Wezz: That's without any corruption.
28/01/2021, 15:15 - Paul: Only if your original distribution has a wall on 1 side
28/01/2021, 15:17 - Paul: Or? Do you see what I mean? If that was allowed to form like a normal distribution, rather than stacking up at 0, it would even out into a gaussian curve?
28/01/2021, 15:22 - Qck: I think you guys are chatting a bunch of bollocks
28/01/2021, 15:22 - Qck: Can someone post some titties in this chat
28/01/2021, 15:22 - Wezz: Yeah sure. If you included debt etc. We're just saying everyone at 0 is fucked in our model
28/01/2021, 15:23 - Paul: Oh undoubtedly
28/01/2021, 15:23 - Wezz: E.g. society has failed them

29/01/2021, 09:55 - James: I doubt they'd accept you as a new patient if you weren't a student, but they have to send the results somewhere

Jokes on you assholes, I ruin every game anyone lets me play. I'll ride this shit into the dirt, shit in the dirt, roll around in the shit and dirt, and smear my shit and dirt on the shares they want so bad. I piss in bottles mother fucker, let's see who has further to fall.

02/02/2021, 20:06 - Wezz: GAMES?
02/02/2021, 20:07 - Qck: It was like when all those anime avatars on Twitter were giving crypto advice
02/02/2021, 20:07 - Wezz: Well now WSB is a graveyard... 90 minutes went from 400$+ to <100$
02/02/2021, 20:08 - Qck: Yeah, it will probably go up again once people are able to reinvest with the Robin Hood money they've withdrawn
02/02/2021, 20:09 - Qck: As I know that can take up to 5 business days, but duh doi that Gamestop isn't worth 300 dollars a share
02/02/2021, 20:09 - Wezz: I'm ready for absolutely nothing to be done about those insanely illegal moves too..
02/02/2021, 20:10 - Qck: Yarp, if anything more platforms will have safeguards to stop the small bettor beating the lobbyist
02/02/2021, 20:13 - Paul: So you're saying we aren't taking down wallstreet?

03/02/2021, 11:08 - Mike: If 10 kills in league is a shot, how many assists is a shot? 20?
03/02/2021, 11:53 - Paul: What's more frequent assists or kills
03/02/2021, 11:57 - Kirky: Assists usually
03/02/2021, 11:57 - Kirky: Assists are weird though cause toy get one if you heal who gets the kill
03/02/2021, 11:58 - Kirky: So like nami gets a shit ton of assists but a tank support would generally get less
03/02/2021, 11:58 - Wezz: Got to be 30 at least
03/02/2021, 11:58 - Kirky: I think we should do a shot per kill and a shot per death and a shot per assist
03/02/2021, 11:58 - Wezz: shot per drake/baron is legit
03/02/2021, 11:58 - Kirky: Yea that is
03/02/2021, 11:59 - Kirky: If our jgl steals other 4 do a shot. If it gets stolen our jgl does 2
03/02/2021, 11:59 - Kirky: üòèüòèüòè

03/02/2021, 15:58 - Mike: Whats max possible herald kills per game? 5?
03/02/2021, 15:59 - Mike: The Rift Herald spawns up to two times per game. It despawns permanently at 19:45, or 19:55 if in combat. The second Rift Herald only spawns if the first one is killed before 13:45. If the first Rift Herald is killed when the timer shows exactly 13:44, the second Rift Herald will spawn at 19:45 and instantly despawn. Baron Nashor Baron Nashor spawns in the same position at 20:00.
03/02/2021, 15:59 - Wezz: It's like reading one of their spell descriptions...
03/02/2021, 16:00 - Kirky: 5 rifts Mike are you mad
03/02/2021, 16:00 - Kirky: Rift charging the nexus

03/02/2021, 16:28 - Mike: Shot Per

30 Assists, give
Shot per Drake, all
Shot per Baron, all
Ten Deaths, take
03/02/2021, 16:29 - Wezz: I like it, i mean, the Drake rule means at least 4 shots a game surely. That's prob too mad lol
03/02/2021, 16:29 - Wezz: 1 game = bed
03/02/2021, 16:32 - Lockers: Especially for Kirky
03/02/2021, 16:34 - Kirky: Maybe double shot for soul?
03/02/2021, 16:35 - Lockers: Guys, guys... are you ok? Like, does Paul need to give an intervention?
03/02/2021, 16:43 - Qck: When I was 16 I went to Andy's house to play counter-strike and he had a bottle of whiskey, we decided each time we died we would do a shot.

I died 7 times in 7 rounds and then died a thousand more times on his bathroom floor.

I haven't learned my lesson yet but I hope one day that we all do.

03/02/2021, 22:42 - Lockers: Might bother watching it
03/02/2021, 23:09 - Wezz: Don't lie,  nothing's gonna make me watch that stretched out fairytale. Except MAYBE the company of some hot geek chick
03/02/2021, 23:10 - Paul: üò†
03/02/2021, 23:11 - Wezz: Literally wrote it just to make you mad loool

03/02/2021, 23:13 - Wezz: Went to go see The Hobbit in IMAX too. That was shit.
03/02/2021, 23:13 - Paul: Hobbit was shit
03/02/2021, 23:13 - Paul: Lotr is a masterpiece
03/02/2021, 23:13 - Lockers: What is the hype with LOTR?
03/02/2021, 23:13 - Lockers: Ohhh look my phone capitalises LOTR
03/02/2021, 23:13 - Lockers: Must be a LOTR fan
03/02/2021, 23:15 - Paul: I just think it's one of the most cinemotograpically well shot, acted, and set movie franchises in existence with one of, if not the, best soundtrack ever for a movie
03/02/2021, 23:16 - Lockers: Nah I'm good thanks, doesn't sound like my cup of tea

03/02/2021, 23:18 - Wezz: Interesting. I watched them so long ago. Definitely well set and amazing new zealand backdrop, mythical word makes acting a w/e. Just was TOO DAMN LONG. Could cut an hour of shit out the first two
03/02/2021, 23:18 - Paul: If it had continued like seasons 1-4 I'd have put it near the same level probably guess we'll never know
03/02/2021, 23:18 - Wezz: Same shit as GoT tbh
03/02/2021, 23:18 - Paul: I prefer the extended versions üòâ
03/02/2021, 23:19 - Paul: They were pretty faithful with the books which was important to the Tolkien estate afaik
03/02/2021, 23:19 - Paul: And those are some long detailed books
03/02/2021, 23:20 - Paul: Anyway fuck you guys. I'm not defending LOTR it doesn't need me to it's perfect üñïüèª
03/02/2021, 23:20 - Kirky: No black people in the main cast üëå
03/02/2021, 23:22 - Wezz: "Pride in one's own race, and that does not imply contempt for other races, is also a normal and healthy sentiment. I have never regarded the Chinese or the Japanese as being inferior to ourselves. They belong to ancient civilizations, and I admit freely that their past history is superior to our own. They have the right to be proud of their past, just as we have the right to be proud of the civilization to which we belong. Indeed, I believe the more steadfast the Chinese and the Japanese remain in their pride of race, the easier I shall find it to get on with them."[9][10]

05/02/2021, 11:41 - Lockers: Teaching from home is draining and completely demoralising
05/02/2021, 11:41 - Lockers: Even those that are set up in an interactive format now
05/02/2021, 11:41 - Mike: The next generation is ruined
05/02/2021, 11:41 - Noone: have they _lost_ computer science teachers? whats the point in changing the timetable from what it used to be??
05/02/2021, 11:41 - Lockers: *generations
05/02/2021, 11:41 - Lockers: Oh in school it's normal, I don't teach like this in normal times
05/02/2021, 11:42 - Lockers: There isn't the capacity to teach normal lesson timetables from home
05/02/2021, 11:42 - Noone: why?
05/02/2021, 11:42 - Noone: isn't there just as many teachers?
05/02/2021, 11:42 - Lockers: But kinda comp sci teachers are like gold dust
05/02/2021, 11:42 - Wezz: Yeah I've seen some really cool interactive methods tho. Like where you can see everyone's cursors in different colours. And help teach them use software. Or using word clouds with their answers, quizzes etc. Some cool options.
05/02/2021, 11:42 - Lockers: I could sit here for hours and explain why
05/02/2021, 11:42 - Lockers: Yeah, when it works
05/02/2021, 11:42 - Noone: I'm genuinely interested, lmk later when you're not teaching 100 children something
05/02/2021, 11:43 - Lockers: Ok well to start, just think about the average Karen and her understanding of tech
05/02/2021, 11:43 - Wezz: Totally didn't realise it was 100 kids to one teacher. That's bs. May aswell just put a YouTube vid on
05/02/2021, 11:43 - Lockers: I'll leave you with that and you should be able to snowball with some issues from there
05/02/2021, 11:44 - Lockers: This is for key stage 3, year 10 and above isn't like that
05/02/2021, 11:44 - Wezz: Ah they combine classes for ks3 I guess..
05/02/2021, 11:44 - Lockers: I've currently got a year ten lesson going on with 12 people in
05/02/2021, 11:44 - Lockers: Yup, you got it üëç
05/02/2021, 11:44 - Lockers: <Media omitted>
05/02/2021, 11:45 - Noone: No I understand that there is a _general_ shortage of comp sci teachers. But before the pandemic, the shortage of comp sci teachers was the same BUT you weren't teaching this many kids. So either, you've lost a bunch of comp sci teachers as a result of pandemic, or for some reason they've made your class sizes bigger
05/02/2021, 11:45 - Wezz: Makes sense. Still impossible task prob should release some nationwide videos covering the topics with few quizzes. Imagine the syllabus is fucked
05/02/2021, 11:46 - Wezz: This is the cool stuff üëå
05/02/2021, 11:47 - Lockers: No teachers lost, there's only 3 in our department. But we don't have the capacity (as a school) to teach a normal timetable as I said
05/02/2021, 11:47 - Lockers: It's not feasible at all
05/02/2021, 11:47 - Wezz: Well done though mate. It's well documented how fucked kids are if they miss education.
05/02/2021, 11:47 - Wezz: I mean just look at Noone
05/02/2021, 11:47 - Lockers: It's all fucked mate. Hate it all right now
05/02/2021, 11:48 - Lockers: Ignore the subject, teaching in general
05/02/2021, 11:48 - Noone: Ok, what's the capacity difference in teaching at home that justifies this size of class?
05/02/2021, 11:48 - Lockers: Tell that to cunt Williamson
05/02/2021, 11:48 - Lockers: How do you define the word capacity? Because I'm not talking literally just size and time
05/02/2021, 11:49 - Lockers: But for example, no school is designed or prepared for this. So simply starting with the focus of resources (classroom, tech, compatibility, staff training) is easy to see why it's not possible
05/02/2021, 11:50 - Lockers: Also, some teachers will have other responsibilities, for example I'm a head of year so I have many more things that I'm managing at the moment that take twice the amount of time to do because it's remote
05/02/2021, 11:52 - Noone: Ok so your time is being eaten up because you have to spend more time doing things that aren't teaching because they're more difficult from home
05/02/2021, 11:53 - Lockers: That's a part of it, sure
05/02/2021, 11:53 - Noone: but that can't be the major reason why the timetable is this fucked up right? most teachers just teach at school, now nobody has to do lunch or break duty I'd imagine there's more free time in general right?
05/02/2021, 11:54 - Lockers: Honestly, I cba to explain it dude. Not on whatsapp. No offence but you're not going to have a good understanding if you're not working in it at the moment
05/02/2021, 11:54 - Noone: fair enough
05/02/2021, 11:55 - Noone: I'm just honestly blown away at the conditions you're having to teach in, it doesn't make any sense to me
05/02/2021, 11:55 - Lockers: Like for example break and lunch duty is once a week, like you're saying that because we "gain" those 45 minutes a week we can do all the other things we need to do. No
05/02/2021, 11:55 - Lockers: None of it makes sense man
05/02/2021, 11:55 - Paul: Just tell him he's dumb don't beat around the bush
05/02/2021, 11:55 - Noone: my Mum is saying her classes have at least doubled too
05/02/2021, 11:56 - Lockers: You're dumb dude fuck off
05/02/2021, 11:56 - Lockers: So she's surely teaching students not in her class?
05/02/2021, 11:57 - Noone: she's teaching multiple of her groups at once, but she teaches food tech so I have no idea wtf she's doing there
05/02/2021, 11:57 - Mike: Yeh at 100 students plus per e lesson just put up a YouTube channel, 1 teacher teaches the entire country
05/02/2021, 11:57 - Mike: No interaction, all education is just videos
05/02/2021, 11:57 - Mike: Rip kids
05/02/2021, 11:57 - Lockers: Exactly, each subject has it's own challenge. Sure computer science has a massive advantage with the competency of the teachers (and maybe students), but open that out across the board it's not even comparable
05/02/2021, 11:58 - Mike: I remember learning maths at uni, without the physical classes I'd have been fucked. Kids got no chance.
05/02/2021, 11:59 - Wezz: Lockers is clearly saying most teachers are super shit at IT and therefore classes are a billion times more difficult for them
05/02/2021, 11:59 - Lockers: Exactly mate, it was hard enough not being able to circulate the room to assist, which is a massive part of my teaching skillset
05/02/2021, 11:59 - Lockers: Definitely a part of it, I've spent hours, no maybe days, going through how to do different things with different teachers
05/02/2021, 11:59 - Wezz: Help out the stragglers who need a different approach etc.
05/02/2021, 11:59 - Mike: Yeh but even if teaches know IT, how do you teach food tech on a pc? Link to recipe blogs and have kids burn their own homes down
05/02/2021, 12:00 - Mike: Teachers*
05/02/2021, 12:00 - Wezz: Well the first step is knowing the tools you have available. Most teachers fail there from what I'm seeing.
05/02/2021, 12:02 - Lockers: Pretty much, variety of different engagement methods
05/02/2021, 12:02 - Wezz: Then you gotta be creative and obv some topics more difficult than others etc. If I was head I'd have tried to enforce some teachers training around remote teaching during the time off. Easier said than done
05/02/2021, 12:02 - Lockers: And then finding different tools as well, again something that teachers just don't know because they're not trained in it
05/02/2021, 12:03 - Mike: Plus the time pressure, they needed this training 2 years ago
05/02/2021, 12:03 - Wezz: Otherwise you just get the IT savvy teachers picking up a load of slack too..
05/02/2021, 12:03 - Mike: Shall we just abort this generation and try again in ten years?
05/02/2021, 12:03 - Lockers: They needed it 2 years ago to prepare them for this? Is that what you're saying?
05/02/2021, 12:03 - Lockers: Oh hi there
05/02/2021, 12:03 - Mike: Pretty much
05/02/2021, 12:03 - Wezz: Well, schools were closed first lockdown. That's when this was needed, realistically.
05/02/2021, 12:04 - Lockers: Yeah, and unfortunately we can't see into the future just yet
05/02/2021, 12:04 - Wezz: Some schools probably did it too.
05/02/2021, 12:04 - Mike: Well there's your first problem
05/02/2021, 12:04 - Mike: Where do I collect my consulting fee?
05/02/2021, 12:04 - Lockers: That lockdown schools didn't have the same pressures they do now. The 3 (interrupted) months we were in school were not enough to prepare for another one
05/02/2021, 12:04 - Lockers: Shove your hand up your arse and see if you can find it up there
05/02/2021, 12:06 - Wezz: I can't remember when schools closed the first time...but would go teacher training heavy during that time. When there's no classes etc. Colleagues will hate you for making more work but it'd have made the current situation a lot better?
05/02/2021, 12:07 - Wezz: Captain hindsight you're welcome üëå
05/02/2021, 12:07 - Lockers: Yeah as you said that's pure hindsight. The requirements (and _legislations_ ) have changed regularly throughout, completely moving the goalposts each time
05/02/2021, 12:08 - Wezz: Maybe setup a course for next weekend?
05/02/2021, 12:08 - Wezz: Lockers saves the day
05/02/2021, 12:08 - Lockers: Also staff welfare was a big thing centrally at that time in comparison to the "it's shit, deal with it" approach now
05/02/2021, 12:08 - Lockers: Suck my left testicle
05/02/2021, 12:10 - Wezz: We get that every meeting at work. USE OUR STAFF WELLBEING WEBSITE. Did you know we have a 'chill out room'. Use some free headspace aps so you don't leave work never wanting to come back. Have 50% off our hospital food.
05/02/2021, 12:11 - Lockers: "here's some advice from someone who is deluded and spends half their life on a multitude of drugs tell you how to be a better person"
05/02/2021, 12:11 - Mike: HR working overtime to not get laid off during the number crunching
05/02/2021, 12:11 - Noone: This is the clown world my memes warned us about
05/02/2021, 12:11 - Lockers: <Media omitted>
05/02/2021, 12:12 - Wezz: Detention?
05/02/2021, 12:12 - Wezz: (lol)
05/02/2021, 12:12 - Lockers: Exactly, another problem is sanctioning. LIke wtf
05/02/2021, 12:12 - Mike: It's called grounding now, Daddy Lockers sends you to room
05/02/2021, 12:12 - Wezz: Dude. Need to rootkit their computers. Delete a random game each time they fuck up
05/02/2021, 12:13 - Mike: Jokes on you, poor kids don't have games
05/02/2021, 12:13 - Mike: Need to use their social media logins to post embarrassing updates
05/02/2021, 12:13 - Lockers: <Media omitted>
05/02/2021, 12:14 - Wezz: We play a game, whenever a big trust meeting how long until someone mentions wellbeing. Whatever keeps you going I guess
05/02/2021, 12:14 - Wezz: You need that resource mate! Remember finding ml in egg cups? You opened >1000
05/02/2021, 12:15 - Mike: They setup teams chats at my work for people to go in during lunch and chit chat, some ok ideas come out of it
05/02/2021, 12:15 - Wezz: Should tik tok their granddad's hairy ball sack or something
05/02/2021, 12:15 - Lockers: lmfao honestly I still don't know why that happened man, I think a key got stuck or something, bare lols
05/02/2021, 12:15 - Mike: State of teachers these days
05/02/2021, 12:15 - Lockers: Also I assumed everyone had hear the "What do you call a perverted IT Teacher?" joke
05/02/2021, 12:15 - Lockers: HES A TEACHER
05/02/2021, 12:17 - Wezz: You're in a company where watercooler convos are helpful. If we do that at work people just burst into tears loool
05/02/2021, 12:17 - Wezz: Turns into counselling pretty quickly
05/02/2021, 12:18 - Mike: What's more awkward, turning to leave the cooler or disconnecting from the chat
05/02/2021, 12:19 - Wezz: "Pull yourself together Margaret, all you do is type letters!"
05/02/2021, 12:20 - Wezz: Maybe just give that resource a little double check over lunch mate üëå
05/02/2021, 13:30 - James: Lockers?
05/02/2021, 13:39 - Lockers: No it's pdf file, idiot
05/02/2021, 14:25 - Qck: Sorry sir but without you circling the room my arms fell off
05/02/2021, 14:27 - Lockers: The depressing part of this is the kids a nerd, proper try hard, and even he doesn't give a shit
05/02/2021, 14:27 - Qck: Yeah well he's definitely taken to your use of commas so the nerd thing checks out
05/02/2021, 18:03 - Paul: ,,,,,,,,

05/02/2021, 20:38 - Lockers: You know what, not just pe teachers, there's a few decent looking teachers now

06/02/2021, 08:54 - Paul: Gamer moment: I once witnessed James play guitar hero on expert and complete the track while standing in a different room not looking at the screen
06/02/2021, 09:00 - Noone: you don't need to lie about James to make us think he's cool, we all think he's cool already
06/02/2021, 09:00 - Paul: Everyone share your own gamer moments
06/02/2021, 09:02 - Noone: I once saw James play shovel knight and complete 3 levels while existing only as an astral projection of his subconcious in a different room not looking at the universe
06/02/2021, 09:16 - James: I've never played shovel knight, but I did spend an obscene amount of time playing guitar hero as a kid, Paul's moment is true
06/02/2021, 09:18 - James: Paul had a game of CS on my account, carried the game with 53 kills, and nearly won singlehandedly 14:16
06/02/2021, 09:20 - James: He also spent around 40 hours of his life watching me play through ff7 for nostalgia
06/02/2021, 09:20 - Noone: wait a second, he did the same to me
06/02/2021, 09:21 - James: Yeah but I actually finished it Jack üòé
06/02/2021, 09:21 - Noone: delete this before the other see
06/02/2021, 09:21 - James: Scared potter?
06/02/2021, 09:22 - Lockers: I witnessed James do the same thing because you made me watch. Then I went for a poo in your toilet and you warned me about it because you kept blocking it
06/02/2021, 09:23 - Lockers: Is the second half still a gamer moment?
06/02/2021, 09:23 - Noone: yes
06/02/2021, 09:23 - James: Yeah, Paul excels at the poo game, and made us all watch
06/02/2021, 09:24 - Lockers: Because he's full of shit wheyyyy banter
06/02/2021, 09:27 - Dayle: Ping me when gaming please
06/02/2021, 09:35 - Paul: I love watching people play ff7 it's like IRL twitch.tv
06/02/2021, 09:38 - Paul: Gamer moment: I once watched Dayle in a css game shout right let's do this. Throw a flashbang that blinded 3 teammates, jump out, no scope teamkill and then die on a game on Tuscan
06/02/2021, 09:40 - Lockers: Gamer moment: I once got a pentakill on LoL
06/02/2021, 09:40 - Paul: LoL moments aren't gamer moments they are gay boy moments

11/02/2021, 12:09 - Dayle: Also for my Coin LOVERS out there this is your JAM,

This is ADA Cardano‚Äôs next major release. https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/goguen/

I‚Äôve read that if they can pull this off, it could overtake ethereum and be number 2 overall

I think this is the release that will allow multi language support on their blockchain. To start I think they support ruby, c#, python and node, c and c++ is obviously a given they will also support Solidity which is ethereum‚Äôs language of choice.
11/02/2021, 12:26 - Qck: Yeah they've gone from 10 cents a coin to 90 cents a coin, so no doubt they'll soon be trading at 1800 dollars per coin
11/02/2021, 12:29 - Derren: ü§£

11/02/2021, 12:32 - Mike: If they can keep up that growth per day I surmise a single coin will be worth ¬£24,000,000 by month's end. Time to invest
11/02/2021, 12:32 - Dayle: Wow do you really reckon i do trust your judgement oh wise mike - all in.
11/02/2021, 12:39 - Mike: A month and a few weeks a coin will be worth more than earth's gdp, you'll want to sell before that though
11/02/2021, 12:39 - Dayle: Nah fuck that i'm taking Mars GDP with me as well why stop at just earth.
11/02/2021, 12:41 - Qck: Lucky the coin has multi-language support for when you inevitably have to sell to the Martians
11/02/2021, 13:14 - Mike: More fun facts about bitcoin, it's speculated to be using 0.3% of all electricity on earth atm

14/02/2021, 00:44 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
14/02/2021, 01:41 - Paul: I wonder if us having beds all over the world forces it to have to render more than it can handle at once
14/02/2021, 01:41 - Paul: Either way. Was really funny üëåüëå
14/02/2021, 02:25 - Wezz: BYE SHOT BOT
14/02/2021, 02:26 - Mike: He needs some downtime to add Valheim to his shot rule set
14/02/2021, 10:32 - Noone: that was the most fun ive had in viddy games in a long time
14/02/2021, 10:56 - Wezz: Happy Valentine's Day you smelly faggots xx

14/02/2021, 11:36 - Mike: <Media omitted>
14/02/2021, 18:58 - Paul: Just heard the bad news boys
14/02/2021, 18:58 - Paul: RIP
14/02/2021, 19:02 - Kirky: F
14/02/2021, 19:04 - Wezz: I'm glad that day is erased from history forever
14/02/2021, 19:05 - Derren: ?
14/02/2021, 19:51 - Dayle: I'm gonna fix it all :)
14/02/2021, 20:27 - Wezz: So, I had iron bow with poison fire arrows. And 100 stacks of 99 diamonds. Thanks mate
14/02/2021, 20:28 - Dayle: Sure
14/02/2021, 20:28 - Lockers: Where did you guys get a dedicated server from?
14/02/2021, 20:55 - Kirky: Dayle hosted it on his box. I heard a rumour Mike has one going spare for the next 3 days aswell üëÄ
14/02/2021, 21:04 - Wezz: https://v.redd.it/83lfxk6mbgh61

I HAVE ARRIVED
14/02/2021, 21:13 - Mike: I did pay for 3 days worth and we ain't used, if anyone wants it
14/02/2021, 21:13 - Dayle: I have been doing some testing for backups and the behaviour of the dedicated server so if you cancel the server terminal it does infact do a snapshot backup of the point and time, No idea really on wtf corrupted the world was in that's still fucky.

Test Case:-
Broke a wall - In Game
Teminated the server via CTRL + C
Started Server
Logged In wall still broken.

--Validated .db file saves on Server Stop.

I have;

Created a script to run ever 10 mins (can be reduced to whatever based on space) to copy the database file - Seems to have worked.

Test Case,


Test Case:-
Broke a wall - In Game
Backup Schedule Ran
Restored from the run backup
roof still smashed.
14/02/2021, 21:14 - Dayle: So i think i have solved the backup/restore requirement moving forward i am now in the phase of getting the shit back
14/02/2021, 21:14 - Kirky: Doesnt even move her arms until shes mid air ü§£ü§£
14/02/2021, 21:15 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
14/02/2021, 21:15 - Kirky: That's awesome
14/02/2021, 21:15 - Paul: How? Is my house gone? Or can that be saved some How?
14/02/2021, 21:15 - Kirky: Wouldn't worry so much about getting it back really. Only reason it took us so long to get to where we are is cause we have no idea
14/02/2021, 21:16 - Paul: Luckily I decided to pick up all my valuable shit before logging off lol
14/02/2021, 21:16 - Kirky: If we just split off with targets we'd have it all back as a group in no time
14/02/2021, 21:16 - Kirky: Like I get wood, you stone etc
14/02/2021, 21:16 - Paul: Yeah like legit if we just actually did some organisation we could smash it out
14/02/2021, 21:16 - Wezz: Yeah, would be sweet to just get portals up
14/02/2021, 21:17 - Kirky: Ye portals back would be good
14/02/2021, 21:17 - Kirky: AND MY HOUSE REEEE
14/02/2021, 21:17 - Wezz: Then we can do the rest pretty quick
14/02/2021, 21:17 - Wezz: Your houses are gay, BACK TO THE DORM ROOMS BOYS
14/02/2021, 21:17 - Kirky: Dorm was cozy tbf
14/02/2021, 21:18 - Wezz: I think splitting into two teams and sailing down each side of the island would be sick
14/02/2021, 21:18 - Paul: Get some people being couriers with carts. 2 miners, 2 wood cutters, 2 1 blacksmith, 2 builders, 1 gardener. The courier brings stuff back to town and food back to the workers on the way back. Then we meet up for dungeons and sleep
14/02/2021, 21:18 - Kirky: But I spent hours off on my own making my seaside cabin üò•
14/02/2021, 21:18 - Wezz: reveal a tonne of the map
14/02/2021, 21:18 - Wezz: take portal materials with us for the journey
14/02/2021, 21:18 - Kirky: Yea thatd be sick
14/02/2021, 21:19 - Paul: Yeah a scout would be a good idea too
14/02/2021, 21:19 - Paul: Find a legitimately good place for the town with flat land and resources
14/02/2021, 21:19 - Paul: Shall we just do this IRL
14/02/2021, 21:19 - Wezz: We beat the 2nd boss, got the key and then died in the entrance to the place
14/02/2021, 21:20 - Wezz: so you didn't miss much.
14/02/2021, 21:20 - Wezz: I like sitting in my chair
14/02/2021, 21:20 - Paul: What did it drop
14/02/2021, 21:20 - Kirky: 10 out of 10 gaming. Just stood in a circle firing arrows for 10 minutes
14/02/2021, 21:20 - Wezz: dropped key to the cave thing in the swamp
14/02/2021, 21:20 - Wezz: each of us got the key
14/02/2021, 21:20 - Wezz: but think only one person needs it
14/02/2021, 21:20 - Wezz: so w/e
14/02/2021, 21:20 - Paul: No buff for the OG thing?
14/02/2021, 21:21 - Wezz: oooo. i didn't get any piece of them to hang up...
14/02/2021, 21:21 - Kirky: We didn't go place the trophy thing
14/02/2021, 21:21 - Wezz: at the weird shrine place
14/02/2021, 21:21 - Dayle: we couldnt go back LD
14/02/2021, 21:21 - Paul: Maybe it's different to that thing. The first boss was never marked on the map
14/02/2021, 21:21 - Kirky: Assume one dropped for someone but we just ran to the tomb and died
14/02/2021, 21:22 - Kirky: Nah it has a thing at the shrine
14/02/2021, 21:22 - Wezz: yeah, i think we would have got clues to the boss if we went in the skele caves. but we fought boss first
14/02/2021, 21:22 - Wezz: yeah. defo gotta hang something up for the buff
14/02/2021, 21:22 - Wezz: but i didnt get prize from boss. maybe from cave? or someone picked it.
14/02/2021, 21:23 - Wezz: all our loot got ruined anyway. all dead in a cave
14/02/2021, 21:23 - Paul: So I'm the only one with stuff still?
14/02/2021, 21:24 - Dayle: I have stuff
14/02/2021, 21:24 - Dayle: Ok whats the vote before i put alot of time and effort into getting lots of shit back for the world
14/02/2021, 21:24 - Paul: Is my house gone Dayle?
14/02/2021, 21:24 - Dayle: Start again - This time with proper backup solution?
14/02/2021, 21:24 - Kirky: Yes
14/02/2021, 21:25 - Paul: Lame ok
14/02/2021, 21:25 - Kirky: The only file we have is from the start of the day afaik
14/02/2021, 21:25 - Kirky: I'm happy to basically start again lol. Just use whatever we've got on our characters
14/02/2021, 21:25 - Kirky: Town was a mess anyway
14/02/2021, 21:25 - Wezz: Yeah I don't mind doing whatever's easiest.
14/02/2021, 21:26 - Kirky: Wont take long to get it all back
14/02/2021, 21:26 - Wezz: portal is only thing that would be nice
14/02/2021, 21:26 - Wezz: so we can continue doing our stuff in the badlands
14/02/2021, 21:26 - Paul: Yeah not sure when I'm gonna next have the time to spend 17 hours on a game in 2 days anyway so I'm down for whatever lol
14/02/2021, 21:26 - Kirky: We can condense that 17 to like 3 hours probably lol
14/02/2021, 21:26 - Wezz: and since we used those items, don't feel like it's cheating really. but let us know if it's possible.
14/02/2021, 21:27 - Paul: Maybe you should shoot the shark?
14/02/2021, 21:27 - Wezz: it took lee and I three hours, if i don't shoot the loch ness it takes 30 mins max
14/02/2021, 21:27 - Paul: World's worst bridge
14/02/2021, 21:27 - Wezz: oh yeah, if you can build that back for us too
14/02/2021, 21:27 - Dayle: Ok so another question should i tumble the seed? me and piper are playing now so i think we should just prog from scratch and we can share everything?
14/02/2021, 21:27 - Wezz: thanks
14/02/2021, 21:28 - Kirky: Whatever you want
14/02/2021, 21:28 - Wezz: i vote same seed
14/02/2021, 21:28 - Kirky: The misto seed is strong tbf
14/02/2021, 21:28 - Paul: Jack why don't you and your mate join our server and play there?
14/02/2021, 21:29 - Wezz: i might come play an hour before bed
14/02/2021, 21:29 - Wezz: addictive shit
14/02/2021, 21:29 - Paul: It stays up all the time right?
14/02/2021, 21:29 - Dayle: Yeah it will do
14/02/2021, 21:31 - Dayle: So having a look there is no spawning items cheats just levels
14/02/2021, 21:31 - Dayle: etc
14/02/2021, 21:32 - Dayle: Vote;

After or before boss 2? so we can do it again with paul?
14/02/2021, 21:33 - Paul: Do whatever you guys prefer I've still got all my gear and stuff
14/02/2021, 21:34 - Dayle: we can do the boss again its no drama
14/02/2021, 21:34 - Wezz: yeah can do it again np
14/02/2021, 21:34 - Wezz: well
14/02/2021, 21:34 - Wezz: infact
14/02/2021, 21:34 - Wezz: i got no items now
14/02/2021, 21:34 - Wezz: so i can be frontline fisty boi
14/02/2021, 21:34 - Dayle: ill just whack it up from where we was the shit thing doesnt have seed from scratch
14/02/2021, 21:35 - Dayle: Ok server is going up guys
14/02/2021, 21:36 - Kirky: You just make anew one and type the seed in right ?
14/02/2021, 21:36 - Dayle: can you?
14/02/2021, 21:36 - Kirky: I'm sure I could enter the seed when I made a new game
14/02/2021, 21:36 - Dayle: Ok let me try from the client
14/02/2021, 21:36 - Kirky: Idk how it works with servers tbf might have to do it in client then copy that file over
14/02/2021, 21:37 - Dayle: yeyeyeye you can sick
14/02/2021, 21:37 - Kirky: Sameseys
14/02/2021, 21:38 - Dayle: TLDR;

Even if i have gone the distance to ensure backups and run and can be run - Just anything that is very valuable keep on your person and perhaps make your own local server. Until the bugs are fixed.
14/02/2021, 21:39 - Dayle: "backups and run and can be run" fucking hell my eyes
14/02/2021, 21:41 - Dayle: <Media omitted>
14/02/2021, 21:41 - Wezz: how big they?
14/02/2021, 21:42 - Dayle: 20mb each - there is a clean up task after 3 days remove
14/02/2021, 21:42 - Wezz: üòç
14/02/2021, 21:42 - Wezz: pruning them too, what a beast
14/02/2021, 21:43 - Dayle: hope they bring out a valhiem.exe -save
14/02/2021, 21:44 - Dayle: renamed the server to - "Magic Bummers World #1"
14/02/2021, 21:45 - Wezz: cant see yet :x
14/02/2021, 21:45 - Wezz: I BE PATIENT
14/02/2021, 21:45 - Dayle: its should be up now i am going to av a baf and order some munch then i might be a NAUGHTY boy and stay up late playing VALHIEM
14/02/2021, 21:46 - Wezz: it's up
14/02/2021, 21:46 - Wezz: misto
14/02/2021, 21:46 - Dayle: <Media omitted>
14/02/2021, 21:47 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
14/02/2021, 21:47 - Wezz: day1`
14/02/2021, 21:47 - Dayle: same seed tho right
14/02/2021, 21:48 - Wezz: not sure it is tbf
14/02/2021, 21:49 - Dayle: <Media omitted>
14/02/2021, 21:49 - Dayle: might not be let me fix
14/02/2021, 21:52 - Dayle: jajaja
14/02/2021, 21:52 - Dayle: done fixed it - same seed lets go
14/02/2021, 21:54 - Wezz: still got none of my map ü§î
14/02/2021, 21:55 - Dayle: user map data might be associated to the DB & config file when created so if you join with your steam ID or somthing it exposes the map
14/02/2021, 21:55 - Qck: Yeah and none of my inventory is displaying correctly
14/02/2021, 21:55 - Dayle: So as i created a new seed / instance it might just be hidden
14/02/2021, 21:55 - Dayle: üò±
14/02/2021, 21:55 - Qck: My map has been replaced by a basketball
14/02/2021, 22:06 - Derren: What
14/02/2021, 22:07 - Paul: You've got 10 kids you don't know about
14/02/2021, 22:08 - Derren: üò≥
14/02/2021, 22:08 - Derren: I hope not
14/02/2021, 22:52 - Dayle: just killed ona raft with a sea monster - turns out you get your stam back when you log out ;)
15/02/2021, 01:50 - Dayle: Portals back btw thanks @447561062944 for the help :)
15/02/2021, 09:39 - James: <Media omitted>
15/02/2021, 09:44 - Kirky: Also thought I'd be dead before 30

15/02/2021, 09:47 - James: That's the spirit
15/02/2021, 09:47 - Mike: Suicide pact?

15/02/2021, 09:53 - Wezz: ...got any more?
15/02/2021, 09:53 - Lockers: Not suitable for here
15/02/2021, 10:22 - Dayle: Also confirmed last night Admin on dedicated servers is scuffed AF and doesn't work - we are at the mercy of the 30 min server save but with the shoddy scripts i wrote to backup the db files we will ever only lose 30 mins if anything again :D
15/02/2021, 10:22 - Noone: So an orc walks into an inn, and the innkeeper says "hey, Where'd you get that?". The parrot replies "Durotar, they've got them all over the place!"
15/02/2021, 10:28 - Dayle: ü§£
15/02/2021, 12:45 - Wezz: Wish I could be in my pants sailing to my corpse to pickup portal ingredients. Instead I'm at work. What a shit day
15/02/2021, 12:48 - Paul: Yeah we need a gofundme and get people to pay us to play valheim
15/02/2021, 13:00 - Kirky: Finished an hour ago üëå
15/02/2021, 13:09 - James: <Media omitted>
15/02/2021, 13:17 - Paul: Looks fine to me. Click all the links
15/02/2021, 13:19 - Mike: Think the font randomness evades filters but isn't picked up by aunt peggy and her 2d vision
15/02/2021, 13:19 - Mike: Signature sounds like template gone wrong, please speak to administrator
15/02/2021, 13:20 - James: Yeah, and I'm pretty sure electricians mate isn't a qualifications
15/02/2021, 13:20 - Nathan: I'd get back to him about the job, seems promising!
15/02/2021, 13:21 - Mike: electricians mate is a job title, possibly requires qualifications idk
15/02/2021, 13:21 - Mike: reQuired is my favourite, looks like a gamer tag
15/02/2021, 13:22 - James: Huh, TIL. Thought it was stupid haha
15/02/2021, 13:22 - Nathan: NVQ level 1 in tool identification and appliance handling
15/02/2021, 13:23 - Mike: "we're looking for all electricians in furness, we're so desperate we'll take friends of electricians at this point SOMEONE PLEASE HELP"
15/02/2021, 13:25 - Paul: You are out of arrow
15/02/2021, 13:26 - Mike: The carrot are happy
15/02/2021, 13:26 - James: We're accepting anyone who's seen a plug at this point
15/02/2021, 13:27 - Kirky: when i was interviewing to be an apprentice one company bought out a whole box if different technical electrical stuff and asked me to identify them all
15/02/2021, 13:28 - Kirky: i was just sat there like eeerrrr isnt this what im meant to learn AFTER getting the job?
15/02/2021, 13:28 - Mike: "hammer, hammer, hammer, expensive hammer, hammer"
15/02/2021, 13:29 - Kirky: i guessed fuse correctly on some massive fucking industrial thing the size of my head then they asked what ampage it was
15/02/2021, 13:29 - James: What actually happened is they asked him to put in a few details and gave him a laptop, keyboard and mouse. He stared blankly and they asked "You know what this stuff is right...?"
15/02/2021, 13:30 - James: "Shit man, this is complex electrician stuff right?"
15/02/2021, 13:30 - Paul: Then everyone clapped
15/02/2021, 13:30 - Paul: Which made no sense in context but no one wanted to be the weird guy not clapping
15/02/2021, 13:31 - Paul: So they kept clapping and refused to stop
15/02/2021, 13:31 - Paul: No one wanted to back down
15/02/2021, 13:31 - James: Some say they're still clapping to this day
15/02/2021, 13:31 - Paul: The collective clap energy formed into a dome around them
15/02/2021, 13:32 - Paul: Slowly compressing them down. The unfettered screams could be heard all around but still they clapped
15/02/2021, 13:32 - Paul: News crew helicopters circled the area
15/02/2021, 13:32 - Paul: Loved ones were informed
15/02/2021, 13:32 - Paul: Clap clap clap
15/02/2021, 13:33 - Paul: Just went on and on
15/02/2021, 13:33 - Paul: For all time and forever
15/02/2021, 13:33 - Paul: The end
15/02/2021, 13:33 - Paul: üëèüèªüëèüèª
15/02/2021, 14:35 - Kirky: fyi gone from nothing to bronze axe in like an hour solo. we SUCK

15/02/2021, 14:59 - Noone: Scents
15/02/2021, 15:03 - Wezz: The bees are happy
15/02/2021, 15:04 - Paul: I HAVE ARRIVED
15/02/2021, 15:04 - Paul: Could do with something to eat tbf
15/02/2021, 15:04 - Wezz: Another bite?

15/02/2021, 17:32 - Wezz: Vaccine done ‚úÖ
15/02/2021, 17:32 - Lockers: Nice one man
15/02/2021, 17:34 - Wezz: I hate needles so just looked away. But didn't even feel it, like genuinely felt nothing. 10/10 would recommend.
15/02/2021, 17:35 - Lockers: Fingers crossed it won't be long
15/02/2021, 17:41 - Wezz: Had a uni student do mine. Long scraggly hair, reminded me of a young Paul.
15/02/2021, 17:42 - Derren: @447429507368 https://youtu.be/jS4QlKexNyI?t=99
15/02/2021, 17:43 - Qck: Did you ask him if he played any games? Happy to replace Paul with this guy if everyone else is
15/02/2021, 17:47 - Wezz: He had a German accent too, not this _pretend shit_
15/02/2021, 17:59 - Paul: I fucking hate needles

15/02/2021, 22:19 - Derren: Did you know siglemic still had a 120 star World record
15/02/2021, 22:26 - Paul: Coz he's the best mayne
15/02/2021, 22:26 - Paul: Siglemic and Ken
15/02/2021, 23:30 - Wezz: The only record he has is the most simultaneous mental illnesses...
15/02/2021, 23:30 - Wezz: Guy needs help these days, sad to watch
15/02/2021, 23:30 - Wezz: Got banned from his stream
15/02/2021, 23:31 - Wezz: For saying "hey, used to love your M64 runs, love from UK" or something like that.
15/02/2021, 23:34 - Wezz: Him and Cosmo, both were awesome
15/02/2021, 23:37 - Derren: üòÇüòÇ
15/02/2021, 23:38 - Derren: Ofc they're nut cases they speed run
15/02/2021, 23:38 - Wezz: Dude... this is Cosmo (Narcissa Wright) now... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHA1qxsLH-0

She's absolutely bonkers.
15/02/2021, 23:38 - Wezz: What speedrunning does to a human brain
15/02/2021, 23:46 - Wezz: Jeeze, I just watched other vids. Not even gonna post them here they're just worrying. Can't see a lot on siglemic tbh, deleted all his socials and just disappeared. Rumours of injury but was also having gender identity issues. Didn't take HRT like Cosmo though, she's absolutely _insane_.
15/02/2021, 23:47 - Wezz: For an abbreviated version for those intrigued. https://youtu.be/SXvBVDR3W1Q?t=547
(warning: loads of mental health shit)

15/02/2021, 23:53 - Derren: This bitch is mental
16/02/2021, 08:31 - Kirky: Theres a video of her scrolling s 4chan thread about her and shes all smiles. Reads one kys comment and had a total meltdown
16/02/2021, 08:44 - Mike: You ever say disgusting shit like that to me on discord you're getting banned
16/02/2021, 08:49 - Mike: Realistically I feel you need an odd brain to try speed running for hours on end, just watching it I'm sure means you lot are probably next to them on the soyboy charts
16/02/2021, 09:51 - Paul: I knew Cosmo went nuts had no idea about siglemic that's sad
16/02/2021, 10:14 - Dayle: why cant i pay my rent with the wood i cut in valhiem
16/02/2021, 10:14 - Dayle: :(
16/02/2021, 10:39 - Mike: You can if you find the right landlord
16/02/2021, 10:40 - Dayle: hows the yacht - did it float off?
16/02/2021, 10:46 - Noone: Brave boy proud of you little man xxx
16/02/2021, 10:46 - Noone: More news in a couple decades
16/02/2021, 12:14 - Wezz: TIL
16/02/2021, 12:14 - Wezz: ...something from 1998
16/02/2021, 12:15 - Wezz: Thanks. So I felt nothing until this morning around 6am arm aches a bit and feel a bit hungover. But that's cleared up already.
16/02/2021, 12:17 - Wezz: Weird feeling, just like a bit tired and achey. Lasted for an hour or two and now feel right as rain. Prob immune response. Anyway, would recommend üëç
16/02/2021, 12:23 - Mike: I see you omitted the part about your new third arm
16/02/2021, 12:26 - Wezz: It's right where my dick was. I consider it a BIG PLUS.
16/02/2021, 12:51 - Piper: Who left Iron in the smelters?
16/02/2021, 12:51 - Piper: Mine now
16/02/2021, 12:54 - Mike: Dayle I think
16/02/2021, 12:55 - Mike: You deleted this message
16/02/2021, 13:08 - Paul: Where did you get iron
16/02/2021, 13:08 - Paul: I don't play for 1 day and it's bloody flying cars
16/02/2021, 13:08 - Nathan: Swap biome in caves
16/02/2021, 13:08 - Nathan: Have to mine some shit in there
16/02/2021, 13:11 - Wezz: *swamp
16/02/2021, 13:11 - Nathan: Don't you correct my auto corrects! Google will end you
16/02/2021, 13:12 - Paul: Do you harness the true power of Google?
16/02/2021, 13:12 - Wezz: ALREEET MATE, CALM DOAWN CALM DOAWN
16/02/2021, 13:16 - Nathan: Alright are kid! I'll fight thee for a brew!
16/02/2021, 13:18 - Qck: Ya wot Kes, don't call her that Kes, she's not a slag she's my mum
16/02/2021, 14:51 - Noone: Ayup ah kid
16/02/2021, 15:56 - Wezz: Valheim made 40mil so far. Small indie Dev team.
16/02/2021, 15:56 - Wezz: Of that lose 30% to steam and other cuts.but still. Looking at 10s of millions ¬£
16/02/2021, 15:58 - Kirky: Now they can all go on lavish holidays, do coke, and forget to update it out of early access
16/02/2021, 15:58 - Mike: This is the way
16/02/2021, 16:05 - Kirky: Seriously would you have any motivation left to update that pos game üòÇüòÇ
16/02/2021, 16:05 - Mike: I'd hire competent people to do it for me and fo
16/02/2021, 16:05 - Mike: literally wouldn't cost you more than 5 mill
16/02/2021, 16:06 - Kirky: Ye or just sell it to big name company
16/02/2021, 16:06 - Kirky: Sure Microsoft or someone would buy it
16/02/2021, 16:18 - Qck: Line who worked at coffee stain studios on goat simulator said to md that they were drowning in cash and said they were no longer gonna develop and just produce games for other developers they liked by funding them
16/02/2021, 16:19 - Qck: So coffee stain is the one who is making the cash and they would already have a bunch of systems in place to deal with the influx of cash
16/02/2021, 16:20 - Qck: -md +me, she spoke about this shit at least a year ago so it's just their plan finally manifesting itself
16/02/2021, 16:22 - Qck: Tbh out of all the independent publishers out there they're probably best equipped and already have relationships built with other platforms from when they released all their other shit games (sanctum etc)
16/02/2021, 17:36 - Wezz: Didn't even know they released sanctum
16/02/2021, 17:36 - Wezz: They're really on the genre hype train
16/02/2021, 18:03 - Derren: @447561062944 @447835575116 https://youtu.be/DlkjqSlkSzs?t=260  I'm so out of touch with OOT, how's he just flying everywhere

16/02/2021, 19:18 - Piper: Mike your cart is broke
16/02/2021, 19:20 - Mike: right thats it, who had it last
16/02/2021, 19:20 - Mike: do I need to revoke cart privileges
16/02/2021, 19:21 - Piper: Na I used it took it to the coast.. then realised it was 1 hp.. i couldn't mend
16/02/2021, 19:21 - Piper: It was already smashed up
16/02/2021, 19:21 - Paul: He's confessed!
16/02/2021, 19:21 - Piper: Na person before me framed me
16/02/2021, 19:22 - Mike: it drops its materials if you could pick em up
16/02/2021, 19:22 - Paul: I repaired it so wasn't me
16/02/2021, 19:22 - Mike: otherwise someone owes me a cart
16/02/2021, 19:22 - Piper: It was Paul on his journey to Camelot this afternoon
16/02/2021, 19:22 - Paul: No Mike saw that I made it back with a working healthy cart
16/02/2021, 19:23 - Mike: did you put it back in the garage?
16/02/2021, 19:23 - Mike: could be mobs
16/02/2021, 19:23 - Paul: I logged off before you did. You knew it was right in front of the house
16/02/2021, 19:23 - Mike: so paul owes me a cart
16/02/2021, 19:24 - Paul: Bitch please you obviously framed piper
16/02/2021, 19:25 - Mike: we need an adjudicator, @447428100241 ?
16/02/2021, 19:25 - Paul: You can't have an adjudicator that's never played valheim
16/02/2021, 19:25 - Mike: no its perefect
16/02/2021, 19:26 - Mike: anyone who has played will clearly side with me you cart hater
16/02/2021, 19:26 - Paul: Anyone who knows you is already certain of your guilt. So you pick James because he has no idea who you are
16/02/2021, 19:28 - Lockers: Piper is a serial killer
16/02/2021, 19:34 - James: I think that trusting any of you is a mistake. I think it's ultimately Mike's fault, but Paul should know better. Piper can't be blamed for anything as he doesn't know better.
16/02/2021, 19:35 - Mike: you wanna know why communism fails paul? because of situations like this
16/02/2021, 19:36 - Mike: now I go capitalist, you must rent my cart
16/02/2021, 19:58 - Paul: Don't destroy our virtual society like real life üòü
16/02/2021, 20:01 - Mike: Too late Paul, I've already bought the deed to your house
16/02/2021, 20:03 - Dayle: RAW CHICKEN funny pancake
16/02/2021, 20:04 - Paul: My house vanished into the abyss with the rest of my things
16/02/2021, 20:31 - James: Are you having a stroke?
16/02/2021, 20:33 - Derren: @447757709019 https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/14067723/wendys-opening-britain-first-branch-21-years-burger/amp/
16/02/2021, 20:33 - Derren: You need to be our Guinea pig

16/02/2021, 20:36 - Derren: Playing wow again
16/02/2021, 20:37 - Kirky: it was inevitable
16/02/2021, 20:43 - Nathan: Some of us never left Azeroth üëÄ
16/02/2021, 20:43 - Derren: üòÇ
16/02/2021, 20:43 - Derren: WHAT'S YOUR RATING
16/02/2021, 20:44 - Nathan: Power level 9,000,000,000. I've gone super sayan
16/02/2021, 20:44 - Nathan: <Media omitted>
16/02/2021, 20:57 - Derren: <Media omitted>
17/02/2021, 07:44 - Paul: Dota Netflix series out of nowhere
17/02/2021, 08:31 - Wezz: What the hell. Weird trailer too
17/02/2021, 08:35 - Wezz: https://youtu.be/JM-NqFX2jU8
17/02/2021, 10:18 - Paul: Would you rather be able to see 10 minutes into your own future or 10 minutes into the future of anyone but yourself?
17/02/2021, 10:19 - James: Is it an instantaneous knowledge of the next ten minutes whenever I wanted?
17/02/2021, 10:20 - James: Or do I have to spend ten minutes to see the ten minutes after I've meditated for that amount of time
17/02/2021, 10:20 - Mike: My own, scratch cards here I come
17/02/2021, 10:20 - Paul: Let's say it's a rechargeable 1 day use thing if it's yourself. Multi use if other people but only once per person per day
17/02/2021, 10:21 - James: So I can't see 10 minutes, change what I was going to do and then see it again?
17/02/2021, 10:22 - James: Because otherwise it's nearly useless. The only time it would help is if you knew something outside of your control was about to happen, but if you knew anyway, you've already got that information
17/02/2021, 10:22 - Derren: What he's saying is tho is that you can see the next 10m but you are spending 10m to see that 10m so are you just watching yourself watching your next 10 mins ü§î
17/02/2021, 10:22 - James: 10 minutes is a long time to run on script without changing anything
17/02/2021, 10:22 - James: Because if you did change anything your vision will not come true now
17/02/2021, 10:23 - Derren: https://www.pcgamer.com/amp/amazons-new-world-mmo-will-be-out-in-august-closed-beta-in-july/
17/02/2021, 10:23 - Derren: New mmo this summer
17/02/2021, 10:23 - Derren: ?!?!?!?!!?!!
17/02/2021, 10:23 - Paul: No because you can think of time quicker than time moves? I can picture the story of Lord of the rings without standing here thinking for 9 hours
17/02/2021, 10:24 - Derren: You can't picture every single detail
17/02/2021, 10:24 - Derren: And details are important
17/02/2021, 10:24 - Paul: If I did have that ability I could still do it quicker than real time
17/02/2021, 10:25 - Paul: You gain the knowledge instantly
17/02/2021, 10:26 - Derren: Again it's pointless init you can't change it
17/02/2021, 10:26 - Derren: Cos then it wouldn't be your future
17/02/2021, 10:26 - James: Yeah, it's like dreams, you can experience weeks in seconds because it's all relative
17/02/2021, 10:27 - James: But Derren is right, either you won't be able to change it, or 10 minutes is too long to not change anything to the point your vision doesn't come true
17/02/2021, 10:27 - James: The only way it would be useful is if it was like the film Next, where he can, at will, see the next three seconds of his life
17/02/2021, 10:28 - James: Three seconds shows immediate future, so very little you do can change that timeframe, and he can use it whenever so he can see a bunch of possibilities
17/02/2021, 10:29 - Paul: Fine no recharge. Just keep using it
17/02/2021, 10:30 - Derren: No new mmo? üò¢
17/02/2021, 10:32 - Paul: No, aion is life
17/02/2021, 10:48 - Derren: üò™
17/02/2021, 11:22 - Mike: I'll wait for the closed beta verdict
17/02/2021, 12:05 - Nathan: What's the point? WoW is always better/bigger
17/02/2021, 12:05 - Derren: WHY DONT YOU GO AND LIVE IN TEXAS THEN
17/02/2021, 12:49 - Paul: The characters look really shitty and low-res compared to the world which looks beautiful
17/02/2021, 12:49 - Paul: unlike Valheim which looks flawless
17/02/2021, 12:57 - Piper: @447429507368
17/02/2021, 12:57 - Kirky: @447429507368 u played that right ?
17/02/2021, 12:57 - Kirky: Lol piper
17/02/2021, 12:58 - Piper: They have updated valheim you need to update your server
17/02/2021, 12:58 - Piper: Lol wtf
17/02/2021, 12:58 - Paul: @447429507368
17/02/2021, 13:31 - Wezz: @447429507368
17/02/2021, 13:33 - Wezz: I'd see three seconds before I was about to jizz then Simba every girl I slept with. Interpret and assess their reaction and live a life of lion king.
17/02/2021, 13:38 - Wezz: Remember when we were watching UFC and Tapan fell asleep. Then we kept asking him questions and he'd answer with snores? 10/10
17/02/2021, 13:38 - Wezz: Voice activation ftw
17/02/2021, 13:57 - James: Is three seconds enough to capture a full reaction to that? I imagine there at least 3-5 seconds of stunned silence regardless of the reaction.
17/02/2021, 13:57 - James: Playing a risky game
17/02/2021, 13:59 - Wezz: I'm willing to take that risk üí™
17/02/2021, 14:24 - Paul: Does this mean your sex sessions are a negative amount of time?
17/02/2021, 14:30 - Wezz: Voila, I've invented time travel.
17/02/2021, 14:34 - Alex: Bet Steven Hawkins always thought it would be invented for a nobler cause
17/02/2021, 14:43 - James: Nah, he hosted his time traveller party and it was actually a massive orgy, then pretended noone showed up
17/02/2021, 14:48 - Qck: Whenever I have to lie about not having an orgie I also say that Jack showed up so nobody suspects group sex
17/02/2021, 14:49 - Paul: Works for either Jack too, nice üëç
17/02/2021, 14:50 - Lockers: That was hilarious
17/02/2021, 14:51 - Lockers: Erm hello?
17/02/2021, 14:59 - Wezz: So you're making a bacon sandwich Tapan, brown sauce or ketchup?

...... snooooooooooooooore

Completely agree
17/02/2021, 15:04 - Piper: racist sandwich?
17/02/2021, 15:29 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
17/02/2021, 15:35 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
17/02/2021, 15:35 - Lockers: Sad times
17/02/2021, 15:38 - Mike: I'd use the power constantly and always be out of sync with everyone else by 3 seconds, everyone would think I'm as retarded but actually I'm streets ahead
17/02/2021, 16:47 - James: Stop trying to make streets ahead a thing, it's not a thing
17/02/2021, 16:47 - Alex: You clearly havent been 3 seconds into the future...
17/02/2021, 16:51 - Wezz: How long's a street in seconds? Has to be at most 1.5 seconds based on Mike's statement.
17/02/2021, 17:40 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
17/02/2021, 17:41 - Wezz: Nice to see bugs experienced by others too
17/02/2021, 17:46 - Noone: Would you rather lose your legs or have Paul spend eternity in hell
17/02/2021, 17:47 - Noone: Hint: there's only one true gamer answer
17/02/2021, 18:36 - Mike: I mean eternity isn't that long
17/02/2021, 18:37 - Paul: Isn't this already hell
17/02/2021, 18:57 - Dayle: Just logged in and updated the server
17/02/2021, 19:00 - Mike: What kind of response time do you call this
17/02/2021, 19:00 - Mike: I want to speak to your manager
17/02/2021, 19:02 - Dayle: Sorry sir if you raise a ticket with our support desk no-one.givesafuck.com we will get right on the RCA for the issue and give you the satisfaction you deserve as a customer for server "The Magical Bummers #1"
17/02/2021, 19:29 - Paul: <Media omitted>
17/02/2021, 19:50 - James: For a quicker response, you can call the support desk at 0121-do-one
17/02/2021, 20:36 - Derren: 1.12
18/02/2021, 08:55 - Paul: My dog food delivery is a week late because of brexit boarder issues. Nigel Farage is literally trying to kill my dog
18/02/2021, 08:57 - Mike: I mean your dog is foreign
18/02/2021, 08:59 - Paul: Golden retrievers come from Scotland
18/02/2021, 08:59 - James: Yeah and humans come from Africa, that's not how nationality works
18/02/2021, 09:01 - Paul: You just gonna take that Derren?
18/02/2021, 09:11 - Derren: I don't understand how that's insulting to me, he is saying your dog is German because it was born there
18/02/2021, 09:11 - Derren: Just like farage wife
18/02/2021, 09:11 - Derren: Also
18/02/2021, 09:11 - Derren: <Media omitted>
18/02/2021, 09:11 - Paul: Yeah man he's saying you aren't a kebab
18/02/2021, 09:12 - Derren: Based on nationality I'm not
18/02/2021, 09:12 - Derren: üò¢
18/02/2021, 09:12 - Paul: Wow dude that's totally racist
18/02/2021, 09:13 - Mike: I remember a big argument in my guild because I'd say the word gay negatively when I was like 15/16, two adult lesbians tried to get me kicked with an ultimatum that they'd leave if not
18/02/2021, 09:13 - Mike: Guess who was the main tank butches, fuck those lesbo gays
18/02/2021, 09:15 - Paul: We'd be so cancelled if Twitter saw our quiplash games
18/02/2021, 09:17 - Paul: Remember when "rape" was synonymous with "owning"
18/02/2021, 09:18 - Paul: There was an old YouTube cs source pro who would go on public community servers and destroy everyone. It had the unfortunate title of "rape in publics"
18/02/2021, 09:20 - Kirky: When clan of doom was a cs team we tagged up ad SS Adolf Hitler SS gerbils etc. Community idiots on the forum went mad
18/02/2021, 09:20 - Mike: LOL
18/02/2021, 09:21 - Mike: Oh but it's funny when prince harry literally dresses like Hitler for Halloween (it was actually)
18/02/2021, 09:22 - Kirky: One of the founders I went to school with was German. He didnt find it funny either
18/02/2021, 09:23 - James: I remember I was on a train home from a gig with some friends, and we ended up talking to this girl. She was really chatty, and made a few jokes about liking being choked and things like that, and after about half an hour, within context, I made a joke about consent.

Big mistake, she lost her shit, and for the next 20 minutes was going off on one about how rape isn't funny and you can never joke about it and it's the worst thing anyone could say.

Alex and I ended up leaving her on the train with our other friend just wishing him luck against her tirade.
18/02/2021, 09:24 - Kirky: Shouldve raped her
18/02/2021, 09:24 - Paul: Ah yes the classic nice to meet you followed by casual fetish talk
18/02/2021, 09:26 - James: Exactly, the bar had been set for the conversation
18/02/2021, 09:27 - Paul: Nice
18/02/2021, 09:27 - Mike: "crazy weather huh? Anyway I was there being shit on in my shower"
18/02/2021, 09:29 - Paul: Although I do like the idea of James dropping this bomb and then peacing out
18/02/2021, 09:30 - Lockers: I'm making 6 bucks an hour
18/02/2021, 09:32 - Mike: I like the feeling of loss of power

22/02/2021, 15:52 - Wezz: Well I can promise you won't have to organise a thing, but can't promise any level of quality to the evening. Suitably chaotic üëå

23/02/2021, 09:15 - Wezz: "New"
23/02/2021, 09:32 - Derren: fuck you bro
23/02/2021, 09:39 - Noone: Aparantly there was a group of players on a server in classic wow who maintained a spreadsheet of all the female players on their server, including images and relationship status
23/02/2021, 09:57 - James: That seems in character for WoW nerds, amirite?
23/02/2021, 10:00 - Paul: Jack was a crucial member of this team

23/02/2021, 15:02 - Wezz: Legitimately unsurprised.

23/02/2021, 16:11 - Kirky: Both of those are top quality additions to this chat

23/02/2021, 16:26 - James: Amazing

23/02/2021, 17:14 - Kirky: @447943624891 what happened to these Christmas party shirts
23/02/2021, 17:16 - Lockers: he thought we forgot didn't he
23/02/2021, 17:17 - Derren: Pyramid sceme
23/02/2021, 17:17 - Derren: scheme*
23/02/2021, 17:23 - Mike: sold your data to CHYNA
23/02/2021, 17:23 - Mike: just need to order them but im literally lazy af
23/02/2021, 17:32 - Wezz: I spent 10 hours designing them
23/02/2021, 17:32 - Wezz: (mostly because I suck at Photoshop?
23/02/2021, 17:32 - Kirky: My MUM of all people reminded me üòÇüòÇ

23/02/2021, 17:42 - Kirky: So disrepectful Mike. Also 10 hrs and you still forgot misto ??
23/02/2021, 17:43 - Mike: what can i say m8 covid delays
23/02/2021, 17:56 - Wezz: Yeah, wasn't sure if Misto would make it at the time... BAME links. Didn't want to bum everyone out with a memorial t shirt
23/02/2021, 17:56 - Wezz: Turns out we're all good üëç
23/02/2021, 18:19 - Wezz: <Media omitted>

23/02/2021, 18:49 - Dayle: Anyone wanna have a lads day out in London when the pubs open?
23/02/2021, 19:58 - Wezz: BRING ON JUNE

At least 15 mins of them behind the scenes lol
23/02/2021, 21:14 - Noone: <Media omitted>
24/02/2021, 09:10 - Wezz: Not sure how I feel about this whole 'Vaccination Passport' stuff. Looking like it's going to be a thing. Doesn't feel quite right ü§î
24/02/2021, 09:10 - Wezz: Gota license for that jab m8
24/02/2021, 09:13 - Lockers: What is the difference between this and getting jabs to ensure travel? It should only be short term to
24/02/2021, 09:13 - Lockers: *too
24/02/2021, 09:17 - Wezz: Yeah, I think travelling is a reasonable compromise. But discussion of other domestic uses e.g. theatre, pub, employment. All gets a bit _new_.
24/02/2021, 09:18 - Lockers: Again though, temporary. I'm fully on board with it to be honest
24/02/2021, 09:19 - Lockers: To be fair I do feel it should be managed appropriately. Ie not everything should require it, ie places that can easily maintain social distancing?
24/02/2021, 09:19 - Lockers: So for example, if a pub has a quite a large outside space, people without the "passport" could use the outside space but wouldn't be allowed in the building
24/02/2021, 09:25 - Wezz: Yeah, best case scenario I agree. Although no strictly right or wrong answer in my opinion.
24/02/2021, 09:26 - Lockers: That's half the problem I guess, you have such strong arguments on either side it seems to be a "choose one and whatever is probably safest makes sense"
24/02/2021, 09:28 - Mike: <Media omitted>
24/02/2021, 09:28 - Lockers: This could be anything!
24/02/2021, 09:29 - Mike: It was actually a hitman for you, no industry has been left unimpacted
24/02/2021, 09:30 - Lockers: At fucking last
24/02/2021, 10:12 - James: <Media omitted>
24/02/2021, 10:29 - Derren: Or you know, your shirt has magical powers that makes you invisible
24/02/2021, 10:30 - Derren: Will @447757709019 deliver his own shirt to himself?
24/02/2021, 10:34 - Wezz: You've kept me entertained during my covid update.
24/02/2021, 10:34 - Wezz: All hail James shirt
24/02/2021, 10:35 - James: Finally, the respect it deserves
24/02/2021, 10:35 - James: Maybe, not considered there was an old TV behind my torso
24/02/2021, 10:41 - Derren: Why do you have an old crt behind you? Are you a pro smasher or are you a speed runner and you've been hiding this from us?
24/02/2021, 10:41 - James: Both
24/02/2021, 10:43 - James: I run into the corner of Final Destination and jump backwards to skip into Gerudo Bridge
24/02/2021, 10:43 - James: Cuts 20 seconds off of my Final Smash
24/02/2021, 10:53 - Paul: Do you get dressed up to sit at your desk? Most I manage is a tshirt
24/02/2021, 10:54 - James: This is a big customer meeting, internal meetings I don't even turn on my camera normally
24/02/2021, 10:54 - Paul: Ah fair enough then
24/02/2021, 11:04 - Noone: if James was in my meetings I'd just be filled with sexual tension.
24/02/2021, 11:05 - James: brimming even?
24/02/2021, 11:05 - Noone: BUBBLING with sexual _tension_
24/02/2021, 11:14 - James: *erupting* with ecstasy
24/02/2021, 12:34 - Wezz: Cummed in my diaper
24/02/2021, 12:34 - Wezz: Hope that appeared on lockers web WhatsApp notification or something
24/02/2021, 12:34 - Paul: Same man
24/02/2021, 12:35 - James: Nah, you just thought you were typing in your incognito window
24/02/2021, 12:35 - Wezz: Real men don't use incognito
24/02/2021, 12:35 - Wezz: Real men use their work phones
24/02/2021, 12:37 - James: Hoping it will bypass the effort of a self referral to a mental health crisis team if work report you?
24/02/2021, 12:37 - Wezz: ...just saving on the paperwork
24/02/2021, 12:39 - Paul: This was a witty joke James well done. Give yourself a pat on the back
24/02/2021, 12:39 - Paul: Bit wordy though
24/02/2021, 12:39 - Paul: 8/10
24/02/2021, 12:49 - Wezz: In what world was this witty? Wezz's alliteration wields wiser wit
24/02/2021, 12:53 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
24/02/2021, 12:53 - Wezz: Fortunately for James
24/02/2021, 13:02 - Qck: Don't let Google define words for you, they're your words, you own them
24/02/2021, 13:04 - James: I sometimes use verbosity as another level of humour, disguising a stupid remark with long words, but feedback received
24/02/2021, 13:04 - James: Why use many words when few words do funny
24/02/2021, 13:05 - Qck: It's only human natural
24/02/2021, 13:06 - Wezz: Thanks man. I'll tell that to the blacks and the gays
24/02/2021, 13:25 - Wezz: It's a beautiful day outside today gents.
24/02/2021, 13:26 - Wezz: Thought we could use it as inspiration to create some new derogatory terms for groups of people.
24/02/2021, 13:28 - Wezz: I think if you're gay and black you could be unfairly labelled a Fagger.
24/02/2021, 13:28 - Wezz: Open to ideas
24/02/2021, 13:33 - Lockers: Get back to work, Wezz
24/02/2021, 13:33 - Wezz: If you print screen and send that to my employer; I wouldn't have to work!
24/02/2021, 13:34 - Lockers: But your use of semi-colon in this WhatsApp group would win you your job back straight away!
24/02/2021, 13:35 - Wezz: I love teachers; they help me take off my gym shorts after class.
24/02/2021, 13:36 - Lockers: Ok, that's enough now. Back on the bus
24/02/2021, 13:36 - Lockers: Yes, that's right Wezz, there is a rainbow on the side of the bus
24/02/2021, 13:36 - Wezz: You always send me to this bus sir. They'll never believe my stories
24/02/2021, 13:39 - Lockers: Sorry but I'm going to have to leave you with Mr Abdullah now. But don't worry, you can call him Derek
24/02/2021, 13:41 - Wezz: Not big nose Derek sir! Anyone but him. I heard he keeps an Excel of all the girls on his Aion server!
24/02/2021, 13:42 - Wezz: There aren't any entries but the columns are extensive!
24/02/2021, 13:42 - Lockers: Well I would leave you with Mr Fisher again, but you know the stories you told after last time I left you with him...
24/02/2021, 13:48 - Wezz: He got all weird talking about Marxism with one hand in my pringles... he asked me what time I finished school!

Said he "felt an uprising occuring in his _lower class_"!?
24/02/2021, 13:52 - Noone: Misto is missing a toe on his left foot. Why? Well, I'm glad you asked-
24/02/2021, 14:17 - Paul: Underneath the misto-toe
24/02/2021, 14:17 - Paul: Eat the rich üê¶
24/02/2021, 14:26 - Noone: learn about Thomas Sowell. He was retarded like you for the longest time
24/02/2021, 14:27 - Paul: Cool and then you'll read all the books I suggested too?
24/02/2021, 14:29 - Noone: I actually had a look at some
24/02/2021, 14:29 - Noone: I think the best one out of the five you suggested was deffinitely Mr.Tickle
24/02/2021, 14:30 - Paul: Mr Bump > all
24/02/2021, 14:30 - Noone: <Media omitted>
24/02/2021, 14:32 - Paul: If only I could find some literature in a format like that so you could safely digest it with the nice pictures üòì
24/02/2021, 14:33 - Lockers: wtf you actually managed to finish this book?
24/02/2021, 14:34 - James: No, it';s clearly a fake flex
24/02/2021, 14:34 - Noone: I had to go back on myself around chapter 13, the out of sync timelines surrounding Dory's childhood trauma got a little confusing. Once I was squared away on her sexual abuse the chapters with Merlin were a lot more clear and impactful
24/02/2021, 14:34 - Lockers: See Wezz, James is the real semi-coloner
24/02/2021, 14:35 - Lockers: Yeah but did you read the bit about where she's a fish
24/02/2021, 14:35 - James: They call me the colon-iser
24/02/2021, 14:35 - Wezz: OMG *SWOON* HE'S SO WITTY
24/02/2021, 14:35 - Lockers: Taking over semis, nice
24/02/2021, 14:36 - James: Thanks Paul
24/02/2021, 14:36 - Wezz: ‚ù§Ô∏è marry me
24/02/2021, 14:36 - Wezz: Just gotta throw th;em in every now and then. Hope for the best   ;
24/02/2021, 14:37 - Lockers: ;
24/02/2021, 14:37 - Noone: x++;
24/02/2021, 14:37 - Wezz: It fits into math somewhere. Thanks for trying
24/02/2021, 14:39 - Wezz: How many noises does one fish make. Five Nemo's on there. Might have to buy myself a copy to find out.
24/02/2021, 14:40 - Wezz: Oh _shiiiiiiit_ the fish can TALK
24/02/2021, 14:40 - Wezz: Well, that changes everything.
24/02/2021, 14:42 - Qck: Did you think finding nemo was a silent movie
24/02/2021, 14:43 - Qck: Had the entire thing on mute "well that's fish for you"
24/02/2021, 14:43 - James: *Waggles fish lips* _Speech card shows_ Blub Blub
24/02/2021, 14:45 - Wezz: Just didn't think we'd do them dirty like that.

Culturally appropriate our voices into their bubbles...
24/02/2021, 14:45 - Wezz: Is nothing sacred?
24/02/2021, 14:54 - Noone: no
24/02/2021, 14:54 - Noone: shot my last nerf dart onto the top of the office ac today
24/02/2021, 14:55 - Noone: third time that's happened, I never learn. Now I have no more nerf darts
24/02/2021, 14:55 - Noone: This message was deleted
24/02/2021, 14:55 - Lockers: Yeah I'd delete that message too
24/02/2021, 15:00 - Wezz: Must be bad to earn the Noone-redact
24/02/2021, 15:01 - Wezz: This is sad - Amazon ammo order?
24/02/2021, 15:01 - Noone: yeah already placed it
24/02/2021, 15:01 - Noone: i typed in "bbc" to go to newsn not realising I was still typing in this window
24/02/2021, 15:02 - Noone: I work with computers sometimes
24/02/2021, 15:02 - Wezz: Solid cover-up. We all know you dig the cuck stuff
24/02/2021, 15:05 - Noone: Big black cock/news
24/02/2021, 15:06 - Noone: I'll never forget how Johnathon Ross introduced Lilly Allen as a "sexually attractive women" during the big fat quiz of the year 2007
24/02/2021, 15:07 - Noone: It really introduced some unnecessary sexual tension there
24/02/2021, 15:07 - Wezz: Yeah, the plural is a bit much...
24/02/2021, 15:11 - Paul: Jack purely guilt masturbates to worker union and production surplus distribution videos
24/02/2021, 15:12 - Lockers: Does he Jack-OFF hahahahhahahahahahahaha
24/02/2021, 15:12 - Paul: Hahahahahaha
24/02/2021, 15:12 - Lockers: I feel like I applied the wrong inflexion here sorry hahahahhahaha
24/02/2021, 15:13 - Paul: HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAA
24/02/2021, 15:13 - Lockers: Spacepandas
24/02/2021, 15:17 - Wezz: Not to worry, he has a 'surplus' of semen spare.
24/02/2021, 15:18 - Wezz: I'd also argue it's a renewable resource
24/02/2021, 15:18 - James: Anyone else seen the cumtub? The word surplus just reminded me of that story
24/02/2021, 15:18 - Paul: Hopefully not green
24/02/2021, 15:19 - Wezz: Racist now are we?
24/02/2021, 15:19 - Paul: üê∏
24/02/2021, 15:19 - Lockers: haha yeah fuck the green people, Paul #whitepower

He shuffles around with his walking stick and grey hair complaining about the good old days and yelling at the kids to get off his lawn. Happy 30th birthday Bedlam üçª

25/02/2021, 11:38 - Dayle: unsure it does seem like a location based proc so i think it might be down to workbench level and location perhaps? or a location with x sinatcnes
25/02/2021, 11:45 - Lockers: Apparently you could throw people across the map with harpoon bugs

02/03/2021, 18:33 - Wezz: Gonna give him a 10-minute summary. Hard to explain why she's famous... previous generations Kardashian, future generations Pamela Anderson? Anyway, I'm not under NDA and you the boys. Will get a good nip slip
02/03/2021, 18:34 - Mike: She's got a disabled son so no standard NHS humour, I know what you boys are like mocking anyone seen as weak

02/03/2021, 18:35 - Wezz: I heard he has his way with her now
02/03/2021, 18:36 - Wezz: Jesus, she's actually legitimately transformed her career over the last 10 years. Clearly got a great publicist too. Loads of charity work etc, taking after her ex Peter Andre (mate of my Mum's I'll have you know)
02/03/2021, 18:36 - Wezz: I'll let you in on a little secret... you know in that song Mysterious Girl?

02/03/2021, 18:39 - Wezz: Was thinking of putting a little slide deck of her rollercoaster life. If you google her now you just get awful pics of her post plastic surgery. Told him to google "Katie Price Jordan". Soon changed his tune
02/03/2021, 18:40 - Kirky: Lmao
02/03/2021, 18:48 - Paul: What did she used to be called? Can't remember. Was it just Jordan?
02/03/2021, 18:49 - Kirky: "cant remember" its ok dude you can admit it
02/03/2021, 18:49 - Kirky: and yes
02/03/2021, 18:49 - Wezz: not sure, she used to come up when i searched "massive boobs"

02/03/2021, 18:53 - Paul: Page 3
02/03/2021, 18:53 - Wezz: I should really read into it. But I remember her on I'm A Celeb, that's when she met peter andre etc

03/03/2021, 17:54 - Paul: No that did happen. But Birdbots aren't really birds because birds aren't real and have arms
03/03/2021, 17:55 - Wezz: We don't have arms silly... We have wings. I flew to the dentist today

Pretty good advert calling out Amazon business practices
04/03/2021, 09:13 - Wezz: Yeah watched this this morning.
04/03/2021, 09:14 - Wezz: Super shady. Surely illegal too it's a direct copy.
04/03/2021, 09:15 - Wezz: They'll have lawyers jumping to help them take ¬£¬£¬£
04/03/2021, 09:26 - James: Amazon don't give a monkey's, they've probably got more lawyers than I have legs
04/03/2021, 09:35 - Mike: Yeh they know they're bullying little guys as well due to their data, all you need to do is drag them into a lengthy legal battle and cripple them financially. Not like they're making any money after you ban them from Amazon anyway LOL
04/03/2021, 09:36 - Lockers: AND YOU'VE GOT SOME LEGS
04/03/2021, 10:08 - Paul: I guess you can't copywrite a bag? Otherwise basically every clothing product would have the same issue. Although shitty thing to do by Amazon.
04/03/2021, 10:10 - James: But I imagine you could definitely copy a bag with a specific name and design combo
04/03/2021, 10:22 - Derren: https://www.techradar.com/uk/amp/news/nintendo-switch-2-launch-news-and-features
04/03/2021, 10:22 - Derren: üëÄ
04/03/2021, 10:25 - Lockers: Bag = clothing?
04/03/2021, 10:26 - Paul: It's the same concept right? Can you copywrite a t-shirt shape or just the logo on it? I have no idea
04/03/2021, 10:29 - James: It's normally about ideas right? If this bag did something unique and they copied it, it's diminishing their market strength. If they just made a bag and called it the same name, you could argue their capitalising on their success and relying on people not knowing the difference
04/03/2021, 10:42 - Wezz: Yeah I read this comment too. Call me na√Øve, but how long could a case like this be drawn out for. Not like Amazon has a super excuse, I feel they're far more likely to settle out of court for undisclosed and carry on their shady shit. If lawyer firms are certain enough they usually wave fees til outcome etc. And if you have a clear case of name + idea replica you could hit pretty hard with projected impact of sales. Then if they ban them from Amazon you've got monopoly shit to go on. I just don't see Amazon going down that route, just send em some mils and carry on.
04/03/2021, 10:46 - Wezz: Either way, the video is a great first step into Lawyertown. Plus love some bad PR for the big boys.
04/03/2021, 11:16 - Mike: Easily years, possibly over decades. Good luck arguing monopoly too, thats a whole other legal battle in itself. You could eventually win, if your pro-bono lawyer is going to beat Amazon's army of drones
04/03/2021, 11:19 - Wezz: It's crazy to me that delays could be decades and they wouldn't be convicted of abuse of process/court disruption. Far bigger risk than just paying out of court or bloody buying the camera bag company lool
04/03/2021, 11:22 - James: Intel gained market dominance with anti fair trade practises for decades, and each time they were called out they shrugged it off, until they were tried by international trade laws for damages against AMD. They delayed the case for so long, and only ended up paying the original fees, so it cost them like a few million for global market influence
04/03/2021, 11:22 - James: Pennies
04/03/2021, 11:23 - James: ^Paraphrasing of course, let me look for the actual story/evidence
04/03/2021, 11:29 - Paul: No i wont let you
04/03/2021, 11:29 - James: Fine
04/03/2021, 11:32 - Wezz: I remember this case. Can't remember the exact accusations though..wasn't it exclusivity deals and 'we won't work with you if you work with them' behaviours?
04/03/2021, 11:33 - James: They basically gave away their processors to the biggest manufacturers to build with them, and told them to make sure everyone knew it was 'Intel Inside'.
04/03/2021, 11:33 - James: AMD couldn't sell their processors even if they wanted to
04/03/2021, 11:34 - Paul: I agree with James we should abolish money
04/03/2021, 11:34 - James: They also fucked them over a bunch of times in the 90s stealing things and breaking deals
04/03/2021, 11:35 - Paul: Time for the dictatorship of the proletariat James you're right
04/03/2021, 11:35 - Derren: All big companies do bullshit, everybody is greedy for money and has no values/morals
04/03/2021, 11:37 - Wezz: Seems they got a coupe different 1.5 billion fines for their behaviours. One from US, one from EU.
04/03/2021, 11:37 - Wezz: Findings:
The EU found, in part:

That Intel paid rebates to manufacturers on the condition that they would buy all (Dell) or nearly all of their CPUs from Intel.
That it paid retail stores rebates to only stock x86 parts.
That it paid computer manufacturers to halt or delay the launch of AMD hardware, including Dell, Acer, Lenovo, and NEC.
That it restricted sales of AMD CPUs based on business segment and market. OEMs were given permission to sell higher percentages of AMD desktop chips, but were required to buy up to 95% of business processors from Intel. At least one manufacturer was forbidden to sell AMD notebook chips at all.
04/03/2021, 11:38 - Wezz: I can tell you now. This happens every day in medtech. Bulk purchases of expensive protheses provide rebate. Not so much paying to slow opposition, that shit's 100% bad
04/03/2021, 11:39 - James: In the words of Gandhi, "Shit's fucked"
04/03/2021, 11:41 - Wezz: I read this; https://www.extremetech.com/computing/184323-intel-stuck-with-1-45-billion-fine-in-europe-for-unfair-and-damaging-practices-against-amd

Seemed to give a balanced view. Defo shady af.

05/03/2021, 11:52 - Noone: Remember when that high class pedophile linked to the highest members of Western society successfully killed himself in his around the clock monitored high security prison cell?
05/03/2021, 11:53 - Noone: Remember how to break his kneck he would have had to throw himself horizontally across the room?
05/03/2021, 11:55 - Noone: Me neither tbh
05/03/2021, 11:59 - Paul: Yeah he does watch parties of all the big tournament games it's really fun. He actually struggles a lot in high end ranked games. At least compared to watching him in other games. But still fun to watch
05/03/2021, 12:15 - Wezz: The original bug was simple to recreate, which made it a terror in ranked solo queue. The only thing that players had to do was buy a Dark Seal, get a kill with Viego, transform into the enemy champion, and die under their tower.
05/03/2021, 12:16 - Wezz: The resulting bug caused Viego‚Äôs Dark Seal item to give him infinite AP, which, in turn, made his auto attacks kill towers in one hit. He could also heal up to full with one hit of his Q ability, which made it almost impossible to stop him from running down a lane and ending a game.
05/03/2021, 12:19 - Wezz: Who let dark seal store more than 10 stacks.. some integer underflow shit lol
05/03/2021, 12:19 - Mike: Bingo, from ze bible
05/03/2021, 12:21 - Mike: Fucking lol, tbf the poor guy who coded the dark seal tonks ago probably didn't imagine a hero which turned into another hero
05/03/2021, 12:22 - Mike: Bet the items get reset in the hero inventory and the ring has a default value of max or some shit
05/03/2021, 12:23 - Mike: 100% something their tests should catch by now though
05/03/2021, 12:23 - Wezz: When you die you lose 4 stacks or something right? So I think it rolls under 0 and goes up to max int
05/03/2021, 12:24 - Wezz: That's my guess, idk lol. Hard to test everything when they just pumping out champs every few weeks

05/03/2021, 12:33 - Paul: Yeah stuff like this is bound to happen the more hero's you add. Every single hero needs to be tested vs every possible interaction. It'll probably start becoming more of a problem in valorant too as they keep releasing new agents
05/03/2021, 12:34 - Paul: There have already been some weird interactions pushing people through walls they've had to patch
05/03/2021, 12:35 - Paul: New agent puts a vortex on the floor that sucks everyone in like enigma black hole from dota2. Can only imagine what we'll have in the future

07/03/2021, 13:15 - Dayle: i can clash
07/03/2021, 13:31 - Mike: Tbf the real regret would be trying to finish it, if you're willing to pour it and leave it probably for the best you don't
07/03/2021, 13:33 - Lockers: You say willing as if he knew what was going on
07/03/2021, 13:33 - Mike: The vomit over my landing agrees with you

08/03/2021, 11:48 - Wezz: I had to google to check, but we've not found a 'gay gene'. Biggest study (0.5mil genomes analysed) estimated 25% of sexual behaviour can be explained by genetics. The rest being environment/cultural.
08/03/2021, 11:50 - Wezz: For some reason I thought we had... anyway, thought i'd share my findings.
08/03/2021, 11:52 - Wezz: I'm off all week - so expect useless daily tidbits
08/03/2021, 12:45 - Paul: Generally gotta be careful not combining environmental and cultural as they are vastly different in developmental terms
08/03/2021, 12:49 - Paul: https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rspb.2019.2907
08/03/2021, 12:49 - Paul: heres an interesting recent paper on how having an older brother increases likelihood of homosexuality
08/03/2021, 12:50 - Paul: pretty well respected journal
08/03/2021, 12:59 - Wezz: Yeah, they're listed as separate factors on the publication. I was just looking at genetics tbh, too stupid to split those intricacies
08/03/2021, 13:00 - Wezz: super interesting. love this stuff
08/03/2021, 13:01 - James: You just learn to love getting dicked
08/03/2021, 13:02 - Paul: I wonder what it means that I have a much older gay brother?
08/03/2021, 13:07 - James: I think it's best for all of us that we don't look too much into that
08/03/2021, 13:12 - Paul: So you dont see giant dicks on Rorschach tests?
08/03/2021, 13:48 - Noone: It's exactly what you deserve

08/03/2021, 22:28 - Paul: Whole day off and only 1 useless tidbits I was hoping for many
08/03/2021, 22:57 - Mike: Some of us can play without metagaming
09/03/2021, 00:43 - Noone: He was telling me how he wrote this app that influences his dice rolls

09/03/2021, 09:08 - Paul: That was actually really good
09/03/2021, 09:09 - Paul: I beat it but it definitely had me on the ropes for a while
09/03/2021, 09:10 - Paul: How much code can you realistically fit into 1k
09/03/2021, 09:13 - James: I think it's ~8000 binary digits
09/03/2021, 09:14 - Paul: So does that 1k include everything from the design through to the code?
09/03/2021, 09:15 - James: <Media omitted>
09/03/2021, 09:16 - Paul: Yeah I could have read that to be fair. Thanks Jim

09/03/2021, 09:16 - Paul: Wait what
09/03/2021, 09:17 - Paul: But that thing played pretty well I thought. Considering it made such random moves in the opening
09/03/2021, 09:17 - Paul: That's crazy
09/03/2021, 09:17 - James: It's just playing for next best 4 moves and recalculating every turn
09/03/2021, 09:18 - Paul: Next best 4 moves isn't so simple. Even the top super engines disagree

09/03/2021, 20:51 - Wezz: Maybe that's why she's living there now?
09/03/2021, 20:51 - Lockers: Mate her dentures can be used as fucking knuckle dusters watch yourself
09/03/2021, 20:53 - Paul: I'd pay good money to watch your mum knock Sam out

17/03/2021, 20:32 - Mike: got my vaccine booked in, if I have autism by months end you know why
17/03/2021, 20:33 - Alex: Because we as a society are better at diagnosing it? Or because you cheat at dnd?
17/03/2021, 20:34 - Nathan: Wait I thought you had autism already?
17/03/2021, 20:42 - Mike: mild not full blown
17/03/2021, 20:43 - Nathan: Ahh the stage 2 autism could be on the horizon
17/03/2021, 20:43 - Nathan: Spicy
17/03/2021, 21:27 - Derren: The vaccine counteracts your current autism, so you will have an internal autism battle once you take the vaccine to see which form of autism is superior

19/03/2021, 15:41 - Mike: Not only that, but then Kirky does more damage than him as a support Nami.
19/03/2021, 15:53 - Wezz: 3.5k games on one champ. Holy shit. That's INSANE. Let's say 3.5k hours. 12 hour days of league = 291 days of playing jinx only all day
19/03/2021, 15:59 - James: That's 93.2 7.5 hour work days. If they're playing 9-5:30 with an hour for toilet breaks and lunch, that's a full time job for two years
19/03/2021, 15:59 - James: sorry, work weeks*

19/03/2021, 16:10 - Paul: Half of you only play 1 hero anyway ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
19/03/2021, 16:11 - Mike: or maybe he does play multiple heroes
19/03/2021, 16:11 - Paul: He's the Zezima of LoL
19/03/2021, 16:38 - Dayle: I saw zezima once in edgeville - punched him in the face. Also i think every one in my school was zezima - the queen was zezima at one point
19/03/2021, 16:38 - Dayle: he is not real he is an idea thats what made him so dangerous.
19/03/2021, 16:39 - Dayle: can this last 20 mins fuck off so i can attack the dark fruits like a fucking savage please... THANKS.
19/03/2021, 16:40 - Paul: Kid at my school swore blind he was at the in game wedding of zezima
19/03/2021, 16:41 - Lockers: What's a zezima
19/03/2021, 16:43 - Kirky: Wezz has like 500k points in pixie. This guy was 3.6 million
19/03/2021, 16:43 - Kirky: Do you never change skin?
19/03/2021, 16:43 - Paul: Yeah but he's like bronze so what does he know really
19/03/2021, 16:44 - Kirky: From his performance literally.nothing
19/03/2021, 16:44 - Paul: Wish I could then I could go in the sun for more than 5 minutes üòì

19/03/2021, 17:11 - Derren: I don't want to know how many hours my char in aion has I think my gw1 chat was between 6 and 10k hours
19/03/2021, 17:11 - Derren: üò∞
19/03/2021, 17:14 - Lockers: And they say there's such a thing as the 10000 hour rule
19/03/2021, 17:17 - Paul: Are you getting a new car Jack?
19/03/2021, 17:17 - Lockers: Is this a crash joke because that was 11 years ago dude
19/03/2021, 17:17 - Paul: Not you
19/03/2021, 17:18 - Paul: But also lol you crashed your car like 50 times
19/03/2021, 18:07 - Paul: Any pummelers tonight,
19/03/2021, 18:07 - Paul: ?
19/03/2021, 18:09 - James: I can't tonight, so maybe someone else will have a chance to win
19/03/2021, 18:12 - Piper: Yea maybe paulio
19/03/2021, 19:59 - Wezz: I leave for one Friday and we're all pummelling each others assholes now?
19/03/2021, 19:59 - Wezz: Could sense the gay tension but guys ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇ
19/03/2021, 19:59 - Wezz: Just eating, be on in 5
19/03/2021, 20:03 - Qck: And your 55hp monk still got bodied
19/03/2021, 20:06 - Paul: You leave for one weekend and your victims can finally stop playing LoL. I liberated the group for 1 weekend

19/03/2021, 20:15 - Qck: I dunno mate I was just making a gw1 joke but it sounds like your monk did get bodied
19/03/2021, 20:15 - Derren: I didn't do any pvp on my monk :(

19/03/2021, 20:20 - Qck: Speaking of Guild Wars and people spending too much time on games, it weirds me out that if you boot that shit up there are still people with thousands of hours in pre-searing Ascalon - people who aren't willing to go past the tutorial section of GW
19/03/2021, 20:21 - Qck: And have just remained in this idyllic space for almost 20 years now
19/03/2021, 20:21 - Paul: There's a guy in wow who only levels as a neutral panda picking flowers
19/03/2021, 20:22 - Qck: Yeah but he's a WoW celebrity, these are just dudes and dudettes who are obviously mentally disabled and found a group that is willing to deal with them
19/03/2021, 20:23 - Paul: This is just us
19/03/2021, 20:23 - Qck: Wouldn't mind offloading a couple of you to those guys
19/03/2021, 20:47 - Derren: I knew back in the day people were leveling chars to 20 in pre searing and leaving them there
19/03/2021, 20:48 - Derren: tbh I miss that area, I think it will be the last game/mmo where I actually felt completely clueless / lost / like a noob and spent time reading stuff ingame and enjoying the experience
19/03/2021, 20:48 - Derren: Now it's just too easy to pick up a game and find guides/builds or use prior knowledge to understand it

21/03/2021, 16:53 - Lockers: It was a draw mate, arsenal brought it back to 3-3
21/03/2021, 16:54 - Paul: problem with arsenal is they always try to walk it in
21/03/2021, 16:54 - Lockers: Nah they're just shit
21/03/2021, 16:55 - Paul: What was Wenger thinking sending Walcott on that early?
21/03/2021, 16:56 - Lockers: Henry wasn't performing dude

21/03/2021, 21:13 - Paul: Good job
21/03/2021, 21:14 - Paul: What did you say to him

21/03/2021, 22:04 - Qck: https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-bristol-56477887
21/03/2021, 22:04 - Qck: Is it really the police being attacked if they're kettling thousands of people protesting? More at 11
22/03/2021, 09:21 - Wezz: These chants going on in parliament square. Can someone inform me. When they're saying "Kill the Bill" are they referring to a legislative bill? Or the ol' bill. Or is it some kinda woke double entendre?
22/03/2021, 09:28 - Paul: No they just love Tarantino
22/03/2021, 09:29 - Mike: Police & Crime bill, gives police:

Police chiefs will be able to put more conditions on static protests.

They will be able to:

Impose a start and finish time
Set noise limits
Apply these rules to a demonstration by just one person
22/03/2021, 09:29 - Mike: lol @ your protest is too noisy, pls stop
22/03/2021, 09:29 - Paul: The wording of the bill literally said any public annoyance iirc
22/03/2021, 09:49 - Qck: Originally it was a sign seen at the Everard protest that snowballed into a movement
22/03/2021, 09:49 - Qck: But yeah it's a double entendre
22/03/2021, 09:49 - Qck: It's the only way you can get away with a murder threat towards the police
22/03/2021, 10:02 - Wezz: The word 'kill' seemed a bit excessive. Got a couple policemen friends who are really nice people. Always look at the ground in shame when I see shit like that.
22/03/2021, 10:02 - Wezz: But then I read this and go, fuck yeah, KILL THE BILL KILL THE BILL
22/03/2021, 10:03 - Paul: ACAB
22/03/2021, 10:03 - Wezz: I regularly message him this
22/03/2021, 10:03 - Wezz: The sheer stupidity
22/03/2021, 10:05 - Wezz: If you can't meme ACAB, you're genuinely retarded.
22/03/2021, 10:06 - Paul: When people are talking about the police like that, the sentiment is aimed at the institution, parliamentary oversight, and unobtainable standards of the police as a government body. Not random policemen. In the same way people condemn the Catholic church for their many awful failings despite there being good priests
22/03/2021, 10:07 - Wezz: I'm not sure they all are.
22/03/2021, 10:08 - Paul: The ones that aren't have the right idea but the wrong execution. Kinda like when a person is rightfully mad about having dog poo in their meal but gets mad at the poor waiter instead of the chef
22/03/2021, 10:11 - Wezz: Well there's a tonne of specific occurrences that are referenced to fuel the sentiment. I'd much rather see them go hard on those individuals than an entire 700k police officers. Then obviously call out the legislations. Problem is, I walked through the parliament square rally twice and had NO IDEA what they were rallying for.
22/03/2021, 10:12 - Wezz: "they need to re-rally" Piper 2021
22/03/2021, 10:13 - Wezz: Instead it's the same stereotypical, foaming at the mouth people I see for every rally. Out there taking any anti-establishment pops they can get
22/03/2021, 10:14 - Paul: Those specific occurrences speak to the failings though. They are examples of the institutions failings in terms of training, vetting, social pressures, and money exchanging
22/03/2021, 10:14 - Wezz: Fueled by equal parts passion, virtue, and boredom.
22/03/2021, 10:14 - Qck: Oh fuck the police come on now
22/03/2021, 10:14 - Wezz: They are examples of bad people being bad.
22/03/2021, 10:15 - Qck: I stick my fingers up at every cop that drives by, I'm saying fuck you to the institution and fuck you to the police officers in that car
22/03/2021, 10:15 - Paul: Vetting
22/03/2021, 10:16 - Qck: If your friend is in the car then I'm sorry Wezz he might have caught a stray but that's what happens when you decide to join a syphillic gang
22/03/2021, 10:16 - Wezz: I agree each time we should use it to address CAPA within regulations. But the passionate response bores me nowadays, good for awareness and igniting discussion. But need sensibility when deciding these things.
22/03/2021, 10:16 - Paul: User was banned for 3 days for this post
22/03/2021, 10:17 - Qck: Honestly it's just upsetting that now instead of the police in the car viewing me as a man-child they view me as one of these mainstream kill the bill libtard types
22/03/2021, 10:18 - Wezz: It's just an oversimplification for the benefit of ideology pandering. Police are individuals too, unbelievable I know üòÇ
22/03/2021, 10:18 - Qck: We're all individuals kiddo that's why I didn't join the police
22/03/2021, 10:19 - Paul: I hope there continues to be public reflections of the failings of the institution as it's a democratic way to show we aren't happy. Otherwise we just sit back as obedience drones and let them do what they want
22/03/2021, 10:19 - Qck: I would honestly do a shit in every met police officer's mouth if the Queen would allow it
22/03/2021, 10:20 - Wezz: But I get your point about the institution. And I assumed it was the case. Just wish we were a bit more accepting that out of 700k people we gonna get some bad rapey eggs. And we need to make examples of them in court etc. Maybe public hanging fuck it
22/03/2021, 10:21 - Qck: Yeah except 1 in 18 rapey officers actually get a rap on the knuckles
22/03/2021, 10:22 - Qck: If I got a job where 17 out of 18 sexual assaults would occur with no disciplinary measures you'd think I was Rapey McGee
22/03/2021, 10:24 - Qck: Off to do some rapes
22/03/2021, 10:24 - Wezz: It's just fueling so much distrust/hatred between police and people. That _really_, when you ask yourself how many negative interactions you've had with police, you realise it's far fewer than thought. And this self fulfilling disruption only increases as a result lol
22/03/2021, 10:24 - Wezz: <citation needed>
22/03/2021, 10:25 - Qck: Google it? I'm not giving you citations you fucker
22/03/2021, 10:25 - Mike: <Media omitted>
22/03/2021, 10:25 - Qck: Had multiple bad experiences with them, have had friends who have had multiple bad experiences with them, had a friend who was batoned in the back of the head when they kettled nothing hill carnival
22/03/2021, 10:26 - Paul: A few bad eggs example really downplays how much trust and power we give these people I hate that talking point
22/03/2021, 10:26 - Qck: I will shit in every met police officer's mouth if the Queen decrees it, mark my words
22/03/2021, 10:27 - Qck: Only 16 of 18 rapes go unnoticed at Visa, hence why I joined
22/03/2021, 10:27 - Wezz: Unfortunate that when someone loses trust it's often a reciprocal route into unlawful behaviour üòÇ
22/03/2021, 10:28 - Paul: And Malcolm X would be proud
22/03/2021, 10:30 - Qck: Yup!

Investigatory Powers Act,  Facial Recognition on CCTV against government advice, undercover police officers in places they shouldn't be under the pretence of 'safety', nobody prosecuted for catastrophes like Grenfell etc
22/03/2021, 10:30 - Qck: I could go on but the reality is I will shit in every police officers mouth if the Queen gives me a hint that it's acceptable
22/03/2021, 10:32 - Qck: Soon Wezz will be telling us that the royal family is a decent institution because his mate's a duke and the few bad apples are the halfcasts
22/03/2021, 10:32 - Wezz: Yeah McDonald's didn't have milkshakes when I ordered on Uber eats. Fucking pigs ruining everything
22/03/2021, 10:33 - Qck: Rather the police was filled with mcdonalds security guards, the strongest of all security guards
22/03/2021, 10:33 - Mike: I feel like you're really in this fort the pooing than the protesting police
22/03/2021, 10:33 - Wezz: How is grenfell police related? Should be used to fight for better building fire regulations or rental requirements
22/03/2021, 10:34 - Qck: Because not a single fucking person was prosecuted?!
22/03/2021, 10:34 - Wezz: If you poo'd some kinda asbestos sealant it'd all be fixed
22/03/2021, 10:36 - Wezz: I heard it's Lockers fault we still have flat earthers
22/03/2021, 10:43 - Paul: So we're all in agreement fuck the police?
22/03/2021, 10:43 - Qck: <Media omitted>
22/03/2021, 10:44 - Mike: I knew wezz was anti police, bad sponsorship choice  üò°
22/03/2021, 10:45 - Qck: Explain yourself Wezz
22/03/2021, 10:45 - Paul: He's doing a Mack and playing both sides
22/03/2021, 10:46 - Kirky: So the ACAB tshirt you got me was a joke to you? @447561062944
22/03/2021, 10:47 - Wezz: Let's just say; I'm not against MAKING MONEY BAYBEEE üíµüí¥üí∂üí∂üí∞üí∞
22/03/2021, 10:47 - Wezz: #selloutstraightfromtheunderground
22/03/2021, 10:48 - Wezz: Senna's black right?
22/03/2021, 10:48 - Wezz: I was just doing some roleplay...
22/03/2021, 10:51 - Paul: I'd like to formally apologise for spelling Mac's name wrong
22/03/2021, 10:51 - Paul: Sorry to all his fans it won't happen again
22/03/2021, 10:52 - Qck: <Media omitted>
22/03/2021, 10:53 - Wezz: Cancel this guy! Bloody cultural appropriation. He's not one of you!
22/03/2021, 10:54 - Wezz: This is tremendous. One for the gif bank
22/03/2021, 10:58 - Paul: Gif banks won't be allowed in wezzs police state
22/03/2021, 11:00 - Qck: Only police banks where the shiniest policemen are held in big Gringotts vaults
22/03/2021, 11:06 - Wezz: Loool, the day the police stop me from doing something I feel warranted is the day I'll be in parliament square, the right to protest is huge and let's be real; can't be stopped (short of Tiananmen Square like scenes). Doesn't stop me seeing police as fallible individuals. And always up for talking about sensible approaches to addressing that ü•∏. Ideally without calls to violent or radical change at this stage.
22/03/2021, 11:07 - Wezz: Orrr, we just poo in their mouths?
22/03/2021, 11:07 - Qck: If the Queen merely mentions the police over the next week I'm going to take that as an executive order to defecate freely into my local community support officer's gob
22/03/2021, 11:09 - Alex: So I'm now all caught up on the chat, fuck the police, let's shit everywhere?
22/03/2021, 11:09 - Qck: Knew I had made a convincing argument
22/03/2021, 11:10 - Wezz: Fuck, you win again üò©
22/03/2021, 11:10 - Wezz: Who we shitting on first?
22/03/2021, 11:19 - Kirky: The copper that confiscated a freshly bought 8th from me when I was 17
22/03/2021, 11:19 - Kirky: ACAB
22/03/2021, 11:23 - James: It makes your heart ache, you hear these horrible stories. I'm sorry you had to go through that.
22/03/2021, 11:25 - Lockers: What's an 8th? Doesn't sound like a lot, sounds like you should get a whole one of whatever it is
22/03/2021, 11:27 - Derren: What is this morning soam, don't you guys have jobs
22/03/2021, 11:27 - Derren: spam*
22/03/2021, 11:31 - Wezz: Kirky has 4lbs at home, the policemen takes an 8th, how much does Kirky have left?
22/03/2021, 11:36 - Wezz: Thankfully, COVID has done the opposite to health care workers. It's not ACAB, it's AMAG (All Medics Are Great). Fortunately an anagram of MAGA. I'm riding this wave today üëå
22/03/2021, 11:37 - Wezz: I want the answer expressed as 'degree of institutional racism'.
22/03/2021, 11:38 - Lockers: 312?
22/03/2021, 11:40 - Wezz: Close; 1312. _0 marks_
22/03/2021, 11:44 - Wezz: Should have showed your working
22/03/2021, 11:47 - Mike: AMAG but don't ask for a pay rise cunts
22/03/2021, 11:46 - Lockers: Lmao literally just wrote this on a piece of work as I read it
22/03/2021, 11:48 - Mike: *claps on thursdays*
22/03/2021, 11:47 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
22/03/2021, 11:52 - Wezz: I'd rather you didn't clap, don't want you clogging the clinics with RSI.
22/03/2021, 11:52 - Alex: So wankings out too? If so AMAB
22/03/2021, 11:53 - Wezz: Instead if you all could stretch or do some Wim Hof breathing exercises that'd be appreciated.
22/03/2021, 11:54 - Wezz: Wanking's always out. If you're wanking _in_ I think you're doing it wrong.
22/03/2021, 11:54 - Wezz: Consult a medical professional though. Don't take my word for it
22/03/2021, 11:54 - Wezz: Piper's my go to.
22/03/2021, 12:34 - Mike: <Media omitted>
22/03/2021, 12:34 - Mike: <Media omitted>
22/03/2021, 12:35 - Wezz: It looks _beautiful_.
22/03/2021, 12:35 - Wezz: What was that lady talking about; pixelated my bumhole. Looks fantastic.
22/03/2021, 12:37 - Wezz: Top modeling @447850499652
22/03/2021, 12:38 - Kirky: Tfw passed out before the group photo
22/03/2021, 12:39 - Wezz: I blame Misto - guy wouldn't put the bottle down. Bad influence.
22/03/2021, 12:49 - Paul: It makes it even funnier that you forgot Derren
22/03/2021, 12:50 - Paul: Sorry Derren
22/03/2021, 12:51 - Wezz: Mike?
22/03/2021, 12:51 - Wezz: You sent the one without Derren?
22/03/2021, 12:51 - Paul: Lmao
22/03/2021, 12:52 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
22/03/2021, 12:52 - Wezz: I call conspiracy
22/03/2021, 12:52 - Paul: Sorry but that's too funny poor Derren
22/03/2021, 12:52 - Wezz: Mike's elbow > Derren ?
22/03/2021, 12:54 - Noone: DUDE
22/03/2021, 12:54 - Mike: Uh oh
22/03/2021, 12:56 - Mike: I had wezz resend the image and I guess I clicked the old email in the chain, even used the older lower Res image lol
22/03/2021, 12:57 - Mike: Next shirt will be only Derren's face to make up for my failure, sorry dude
22/03/2021, 12:57 - Paul: Sam already did that for me
22/03/2021, 12:59 - Wezz: üòÇ can't get the staff these days. 90¬£ import tax too. Thanks for the shirt though Mike. I'll draw Derren on mine
22/03/2021, 13:05 - Kirky: I knew 1.5 litres of rum was a mistake
22/03/2021, 13:12 - Derren: I want my money back cheers mate
22/03/2021, 13:12 - Derren: Don't bother sending me a shirt
22/03/2021, 13:12 - Derren: <Media omitted>
22/03/2021, 13:33 - Mike: The worst part is the woman emailed and said hey the image is too low Res, I responded with don't worry here's a slighter higher res image and sent her A FUCKING LOWER ONE. Probably thinks in retarded.
22/03/2021, 13:33 - Mike: I'm*
22/03/2021, 13:33 - Derren: You are a retard
22/03/2021, 13:36 - Paul: Yeah I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that this confirms that you are clinically mentally spastic
22/03/2021, 13:38 - Mike: Realistically probably an improvement not to have your own face on your shirt, conceited much?
22/03/2021, 13:38 - Mike: Anyway enjoy your shirts guys
22/03/2021, 13:39 - Paul: This is worse than when you doubled down on the DnD cheating
22/03/2021, 13:51 - Mike: Worse for you maybe, I had loads of fun
22/03/2021, 14:40 - Wezz: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l5_wMFvY8M

Enjoyed this over lunch
22/03/2021, 15:04 - Dayle: <Media omitted>
22/03/2021, 15:06 - Mike: Time to build me a protesting app, then sell it to police to track who to arrest at a riot
22/03/2021, 15:16 - Paul: Already illegal to insult any state official in Germany
22/03/2021, 15:18 - Paul: It's nuts to me. My mate got a 300 euro fine for calling a guy a bureaucratic bootlicker
22/03/2021, 15:18 - Dayle: <Media omitted>
23/03/2021, 08:00 - Kirky: Happy 1 year lockdownivversary
23/03/2021, 10:44 - Qck: Merry Lockdown to All
23/03/2021, 10:59 - Derren: Actual legit question
23/03/2021, 10:59 - Derren: Would it not be smart for the for sale / to rent signs outside of houses to have QR codes on them?
23/03/2021, 11:05 - Lockers: Definitely
23/03/2021, 11:09 - Qck: Mike's just ran down two flights of stairs to alert Jack to a new app idea
23/03/2021, 11:10 - Derren: You don't really need an app, all phone camera apps scan QR codes and present you with a link
23/03/2021, 11:11 - James: Don't even need a QR code, you could take a picture of the sign, and compare it with your current GPS location to give you the site with their listing for the house, right? The sign will have the company, and the type of listing (let/sale)
23/03/2021, 11:11 - Derren: just need the estate agents to print them on a board, or even the home owner can print it and stick it
23/03/2021, 11:11 - James: That's an app idea, otherwise you need all estate agents on board to change their signs
23/03/2021, 11:12 - Derren: I wasn't suggesting an app idea, just something that makes logical sense üòÇ
23/03/2021, 11:13 - James: Too late, we're taking this to market, you've surrendered all rights
23/03/2021, 11:13 - Derren: üëÄ
23/03/2021, 11:13 - Qck: Well they've already started on the prototype
23/03/2021, 11:14 - Qck: I've just bought the house.com domain
23/03/2021, 11:14 - Qck: Let's make millions
23/03/2021, 11:20 - Paul: This will be used in the settlement case when Derren tries to get money like in the social network
23/03/2021, 11:21 - Qck: Derek Winklepicker and his twin Derep Winklepicker
23/03/2021, 11:22 - Paul: "If you'd have thought of estate agent app you'd have made estate agent app" - James with a smug stare
23/03/2021, 11:22 - Qck: Sounds like a Kevin from the office quote so it does check out
23/03/2021, 11:22 - Dayle: That's actually a very good idea - can also call latest location crime stats and do some other cross referencing of data according the cohort of residents.
23/03/2021, 11:23 - Paul: I'll put 100 quid in
23/03/2021, 11:26 - Paul: Although when our whole enterprise can be defeated by someone putting their own QR code on their sign maybe we're in trouble
23/03/2021, 11:26 - Dayle: Or there could be a markup system like a dating site where you quickly scan the QR code based on your personal preferences deducted from a survey and give an overall score to give more of a minimalist approach for finding houses.
23/03/2021, 11:26 - Dayle: Interesting...
23/03/2021, 11:33 - Dayle: I would actually be so down for making this Hahaha
23/03/2021, 11:34 - Paul: Can't wait to see Dayle on dragons den
23/03/2021, 11:34 - Dayle: Findyourbotlane.com
23/03/2021, 11:35 - Paul: Tell Duncan bannatyne to get in a bin
23/03/2021, 11:36 - Qck: Too late, Jack and Mike are already listed on the NYSE
23/03/2021, 11:37 - Dayle: Dream team
23/03/2021, 11:39 - Dayle: Make it feel sell everyone's data and become rich ez
23/03/2021, 11:40 - Dayle: free**
23/03/2021, 11:43 - Dayle: only thing is QR codes are shit and everyone hates them get a RFC within the forsale sign and if the app is proximity based scanning and when you walk passed houses it auto allocates them into pots of selection so you dont have to fuck about fam
23/03/2021, 11:43 - Dayle: RFID***
23/03/2021, 11:46 - Paul: theo paphitis takes dayles phone and tries to break it in half with his bare hands
23/03/2021, 11:58 - Qck: <Media omitted>
23/03/2021, 11:59 - Mike: Nandos does this for restaurant e-queuing
23/03/2021, 12:00 - Mike: "why's my phone battery dead you might ask" ü§£
23/03/2021, 12:00 - Dayle: fuck the consumers all we want is data to sell
23/03/2021, 12:27 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
23/03/2021, 12:27 - Wezz: Do a handstand at 9pm, clap your hands for a bit, have a wank at 10.05pm. Do a poo at 10.08pm. etc
23/03/2021, 12:28 - Dayle: <Media omitted>
23/03/2021, 12:59 - Noone: shine a light at my front door? from inside? my WOODEN DOOR
23/03/2021, 12:59 - Wezz: Yes please.
23/03/2021, 12:59 - Noone: rihto boris
23/03/2021, 13:04 - Paul: Covid warioware
23/03/2021, 13:08 - James: I can literally picture a minigame of having to social distance from a crowd of oblivious japanese tourists until the time runs out
23/03/2021, 13:16 - Qck: Haha, Mike's ran downstairs again to pitch this as an app
23/03/2021, 13:26 - Mike: Too late, already exists
23/03/2021, 13:27 - James: I should stop putting my million dollar ideas in this vulture chat
23/03/2021, 16:13 - James: <Media omitted>
23/03/2021, 16:17 - Paul: Chkdsk /p /r?
23/03/2021, 16:26 - Derren: Why wasn't I aware of the 1 minute silence o.o
23/03/2021, 16:26 - Derren: nice speedy hard drive you got there
23/03/2021, 16:36 - James: Pretty sure it's dying, I'm doing this as it won't show up in my defrag menu, and it was completely full as of yesterday, so I got rid of 500 GB of games. Probably needs a bit of cleaning up now.
23/03/2021, 16:40 - Derren: Is it a spinning disk?
23/03/2021, 16:41 - James: Yeah, HDD, it's a secondary drive filled with old crap
23/03/2021, 16:45 - Kirky: Did it find the incredible thing it was looking for ?
23/03/2021, 16:45 - Wezz: Sounds like you're being oppressed, I'd look into that.
23/03/2021, 16:47 - Wezz: Those mouse bungee things are like a wristwatch. Sign of class.
23/03/2021, 16:47 - Derren: Cmon rich boy, my 2ndary drive is a 1tb m.2 nvme drive üëÄ
23/03/2021, 16:48 - Wezz: You've fallen into one of Derren's traps. He's set you up in order to boast about his overpriced Aion rig
23/03/2021, 16:52 - James: My third drive is a serf inscribing a solid gold tablet with his grandmother's bones, so don't flex @ me
23/03/2021, 17:15 - Paul: Derren only asks about your harddrive so he can steal it like he did to lockers
23/03/2021, 17:38 - Kirky: Classic Derren
23/03/2021, 17:38 - Kirky: Shame he couldn't steal mikes to replace the t shirt image
23/03/2021, 17:41 - Paul: üòÖüòÖü§°ü§°üòÇüòÇüòÇ
23/03/2021, 18:14 - Dayle: Hi
23/03/2021, 18:24 - Lockers: So so fucking creepy and weird
23/03/2021, 19:04 - Derren: üßê
23/03/2021, 19:09 - Dayle: anyone wanna play cod or valorant?
23/03/2021, 19:56 - Lockers: <Media omitted>
23/03/2021, 20:21 - Qck: I wouldn't allow that Dayle
23/03/2021, 20:46 - Paul: This is nearly as harsh as when piper said I look like Theon Greyjoy after going on about how much he looks like Ryan Gosling
23/03/2021, 20:51 - Dayle: I dont know what jack that is there both under cunt in my phone :| so im really not too sure who im fighting
23/03/2021, 20:51 - Wezz: Ouch, and Piper only ever tells the truth.
23/03/2021, 20:52 - Paul: Better just beat them both up
23/03/2021, 20:52 - Dayle: makes the most sense.
23/03/2021, 20:53 - Dayle: Is that people who do nothing?
23/03/2021, 20:53 - Dayle: GABADI G is a fucking legend
23/03/2021, 20:53 - Dayle: wen to hounslow for some garlic bread
23/03/2021, 20:53 - Lockers: Yeah just started watching it beats m8
23/03/2021, 20:59 - Qck: Are you saying that in your head you're better looking than Theon?
23/03/2021, 20:59 - Lockers: Theon definitely got a bigger dick
23/03/2021, 21:00 - Paul: Don't make me bring up the woman in the bar who said I'm the best looking except Ed again
23/03/2021, 21:00 - Qck: You're itching for some fisticuffs I can tell
23/03/2021, 21:00 - Qck: Hahahahaha
23/03/2021, 21:01 - Qck: How many times has Julia had to hear a version of that story I wonder?
23/03/2021, 21:02 - Paul: She make me tell it during sex
23/03/2021, 21:19 - Wezz: Dragonflies are such good hunters because each of it's 4 wings can move independently which is not common in the insect world. This allows changes of direction and speed incredibly quickly. In addition, their entire head is basically eyes, seeing both UV and polarized light, which gives them an incredible field of view. To take in all this eyesight data their brain interprets up to 300 images per second. They have a 95% kill success rate.
23/03/2021, 21:20 - Paul: <Media omitted>
23/03/2021, 21:22 - Lockers: ???
23/03/2021, 21:22 - Lockers: Wasted joke
23/03/2021, 21:25 - Paul: I guess it hurt bad if you're still sad about it a month later
23/03/2021, 21:26 - Lockers: I drafted it out and got NOTHING
23/03/2021, 21:46 - Derren: You shouldn't be upset that Piper is better looking than you, you should be uplifting your fellow brethren
23/03/2021, 21:47 - Paul: That wasn't the part that I found offensive
23/03/2021, 21:48 - Derren: I mean all gingers look the same so he's got a point
24/03/2021, 10:43 - Noone: <Media omitted>

24/03/2021, 11:31 - Lockers: Thanks mate
24/03/2021, 11:33 - Paul: If you're in the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA), Switzerland or the United Kingdom:
The Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMSD) is an EU-wide coordination of national legislation on audiovisual media ‚Äì both traditional TV broadcasts and on-demand services. Recently, AVMSD was revised to extend certain rules to video-sharing platforms (VSPs).

In line with AVMSD, you may be asked to re-verify your date of birth when watching age-restricted videos. Follow the prompts to submit an image of a valid ID or credit card. Learn more about what we do with your ID/credit card.
24/03/2021, 11:34 - James: Just saying, I've never tried to watch porn on Youtube, and I've never had it come up...
24/03/2021, 11:36 - Lockers: So you have to attach relevant ID to your account and it will verify it thereafter?
24/03/2021, 11:37 - Paul: yup
24/03/2021, 11:37 - Lockers: Interesting
24/03/2021, 11:37 - Lockers: Wonder how this'll impact other services like vimeo etc
24/03/2021, 11:39 - Paul: I was thinking more so VPN clients
24/03/2021, 11:40 - Lockers: Oh of course
24/03/2021, 11:40 - Lockers: But if its linked to account?
24/03/2021, 11:40 - Paul: Yeah so make an account from the US lol
24/03/2021, 11:41 - Lockers: And VPN from US?
24/03/2021, 11:41 - Lockers: Oh sorry duh
24/03/2021, 11:43 - Lockers: Noticed it included UK but EU law, wonder if there's plans/discussions about it over here
24/03/2021, 11:43 - Paul: They can't even get the ports working properly I doubt they're thinking about obscure online laws
24/03/2021, 11:46 - Lockers: Oh?
24/03/2021, 11:46 - Lockers: Oh sorry, physical ports with boats and shit üòÇ
24/03/2021, 11:47 - James: Yeah, I wondered what Paul was doing with Youtube that needed network ports
24/03/2021, 11:51 - Lockers: Lol nerd
24/03/2021, 11:56 - James: You're literally a teacher, biggest nerd of them all
24/03/2021, 11:57 - Lockers: Oh hun, I don't think you understand what I do
24/03/2021, 11:57 - Kirky: I'm with James. Your job is to make MORE nerds
24/03/2021, 11:58 - Paul: Teachers are the biggest nerds in the classroom Jack, all they want to do is learn and read and shit
24/03/2021, 11:58 - Lockers: *I don't think I understand what I'm doing
24/03/2021, 11:58 - Lockers: Alright Mr pretty horrible dick
24/03/2021, 11:58 - Paul: that's Dr. to you
24/03/2021, 11:59 - Lockers: What does that stand for, dreadful retard? LOL
24/03/2021, 12:48 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
24/03/2021, 12:48 - Wezz: Sorry, channeled my inner Dayle there...
24/03/2021, 12:48 - Wezz: Facebook memes
24/03/2021, 13:01 - Derren: ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
24/03/2021, 13:01 - Derren: 45 year old woman
24/03/2021, 13:01 - Wezz: Not even my final form
24/03/2021, 13:02 - Wezz: Already seen few fake ID generators to bypass them. Country specific.
24/03/2021, 14:26 - Qck: I did this months ago to watch some rugby fights on YouTube, it's not a GER thing

24/03/2021, 17:34 - Kirky: Fucking hard London squirrels dont give a fuck ü§£ they run at nothing around here
24/03/2021, 18:07 - Derren: All the animals here are like this, pigeons basically jump on you now
24/03/2021, 19:11 - Paul: Derren confirmed scared of pigeons
24/03/2021, 21:44 - Wezz: I could have punched it and it'd've been like _y'what mate?_

24/03/2021, 21:58 - Wezz: Ignoring the voiceover, that weirded me out. Only saw a couple of these before
24/03/2021, 22:06 - Mike: paedo confirmed, Q was right
24/03/2021, 22:12 - Mike: <Media omitted>
24/03/2021, 22:17 - Wezz: forgot
24/03/2021, 22:20 - Qck: Yeah much preferred it when Obama would dronestrike kids instead of fiddle with them
24/03/2021, 22:23 - Wezz: Least he only dronestriked the poor brown ones. Why didn't Fox news just play that webm on repeat for the entire election? Narrative is transparent enough already, may as well be effective.
24/03/2021, 22:24 - Qck: Because Fox News is ran by paedophiles probably
24/03/2021, 22:25 - Wezz: Ah damn, fucking paedo venn diagram
24/03/2021, 22:26 - Wezz: Found an opening lyric to a new song

25/03/2021, 06:54 - Mike: What a lovely way to wake up this morning
25/03/2021, 07:55 - James: This is amazing. Keeping the arts alive.
25/03/2021, 08:34 - Wezz: Such a lovely gentle song about pedos. Just what I needed to get me through the day.
25/03/2021, 08:47 - Mike: https://youtu.be/JcjS54rCmYk?t=31
25/03/2021, 09:26 - Paul: Nipple
25/03/2021, 09:27 - Wezz: Reddit backtracking on their behaviour is too funny. Literally locked subs last night for false 'doxing' claims. Loads of proof floating about lool
25/03/2021, 09:28 - Lockers: Someone ban this old man already
25/03/2021, 09:41 - Qck: Many thanks y'all, I did it for the kids
25/03/2021, 10:57 - Mike: What's everyone's opinions on vaccine passports for pubs, clubs, travel etc?
25/03/2021, 10:58 - Mike: Jonathan Neame, of the Shepherd Neame pub chain, says showing a vaccination certificate to enter a pub was ‚Äúa poorly thought-out idea"

Peter Marks, owner of the Deltic Group, Britain‚Äôs largest nightclub operator, said clubbers would likely accept the idea of vaccination certificates

Just read these and thought is there not an overlap of these two groups?
25/03/2021, 10:59 - Tapan: Since I'm probably going to be one of the last in line to get the vaccine, pls no
25/03/2021, 11:03 - Mike: The impact on mental health of being the last teenager in Britain to receive the vaccine should be studied
25/03/2021, 11:03 - Mike: We release him from his sealed box and study him like the Truman show, where does he go first?
25/03/2021, 11:03 - Kirky: Brothel
25/03/2021, 11:04 - Mike: Gets stabbed by a hooker, rip
25/03/2021, 11:04 - Lockers: Neames son is a cocky prick, was on a course with him once. He's probably thinking about the resistance of old people
25/03/2021, 11:07 - Derren: From what I read, it's up to  pub/club owners if they want to enforce an entry to only vaccinated people which I doubt they will do as most of their spenders will be people without vaccines
25/03/2021, 11:07 - Derren: Plus it will be summer soon, people would prefer to be out drinking rather than sitting in a dark shitty pub where drinks cost 10 quid
25/03/2021, 11:11 - Mike: Clubs simply won't be allowed to open until a herd immunity via vaccine is achieved I'd expect, spread risk is crazy high indoors with heavy breathing. It's let in vaccinated or don't open I'd guess.
25/03/2021, 13:02 - Paul: Pub gardens exist
25/03/2021, 13:06 - Derren: too small bro
25/03/2021, 13:06 - Kirky: Imagine living in a city not in the cotswold
25/03/2021, 13:07 - Kirky: I could pick a direction walk 10 minutes and any pub will have a sick garden
25/03/2021, 13:20 - Wezz: Totally think there'll be a minority of establishments that require vaccination. E.g. Pimlico Plumbers came out and said all employees must be vaccinated or will be fired. Pretty extreme but private so fair I guess.
25/03/2021, 13:22 - Wezz: Imagine pubs and clubs will cater to vaccination elitism. Would go as far as some denying certain manufacturers vaccines xD. Why not. Idiots love to belong to 'exclusive' groups
25/03/2021, 13:23 - Kirky: PFIZER NIGHT, WEDNESDAY THURSDAYS
25/03/2021, 13:23 - Kirky: BRO GOTTA GET ME DAT PFIZER SO WE CAN GO TO THESE SICK PARTYS
25/03/2021, 13:23 - Wezz: Half price entry with proof of vaccination
25/03/2021, 13:23 - Kirky: Black market for certain vaccines pops up
25/03/2021, 13:23 - Wezz: *95%
25/03/2021, 13:24 - Kirky: Fake proof cards
25/03/2021, 13:24 - Kirky: PFIZER FESTIVAL 2022 LETS GOOOO
25/03/2021, 13:25 - Wezz: I'm totally against the need for identification unless it's for protection. Let the unprotected come and die in a night club, that's fine by me.
25/03/2021, 13:25 - Wezz: Rather have choice than enforced identification. Clubs slight exception since identification was already in place for safety. Same with flying etc. But supermarkets or pubs etc, not interested.
25/03/2021, 13:27 - Wezz: Wait, I mean clubs should just use ID. Not vaccination status. Unless it means they open sooner in some phased lool. Not thought this through.
25/03/2021, 13:28 - Wezz: Found myself sitting at the computer singing "ah damn, fucking pedo venn diagram" without realising my company
25/03/2021, 15:26 - Wezz: Your BAME man. Higher risk. Get yourself registered üëåüëå
25/03/2021, 15:26 - Wezz: BAME man is like superman, but cooler.
25/03/2021, 15:26 - Paul: BIG ARSE MAN ENERGY
25/03/2021, 15:26 - Wezz: This is now the Wesley chat. Only I type. I like it
25/03/2021, 15:27 - Wezz: Solid 9/10 joke. Swift. Some would say; witty.
25/03/2021, 17:38 - Paul: She's trans.
25/03/2021, 17:44 - Kirky: <Media omitted>
25/03/2021, 17:45 - Kirky: The amount of Harry Potter stuff in this chat compared to how much was in the wow guild chat a couple years ago is quite frankly embarrasing
25/03/2021, 17:45 - Qck: The kiwifarms thread on Aimee Challoner was something else
25/03/2021, 17:45 - Paul: He needs to sort out his priorities

25/03/2021, 20:13 - Dayle: she?

26/03/2021, 09:02 - Wezz: Wtf that's sick! Will set reminder for this eve and snap something. I'm on other side of it so not sure how proj mapping will look
26/03/2021, 09:13 - Derren: It happened on Sunday already
26/03/2021, 09:27 - Derren: <Media omitted>
26/03/2021, 09:42 - Paul: I can't even figure out what side this video is on. Just UK sucks side? If so then +1
26/03/2021, 09:42 - James: Radical Centrist. Shows how ridiculous both sides are.
26/03/2021, 09:43 - Paul: Pick a lane losers
26/03/2021, 09:48 - Wezz: So we can all be a little wrong? Nah thanks
26/03/2021, 09:48 - Paul: Pussy
26/03/2021, 09:48 - Wezz: Literally the opposite, I get ostracised by both groups. It's great.
26/03/2021, 09:49 - James: Paul is trying to incite political divisiveness so he can get his reddit tendies on his hate subreddit
26/03/2021, 09:49 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
26/03/2021, 09:50 - James: I noticed that as well haha, it's below adverage quality
26/03/2021, 09:50 - Paul: You mean Stold boy
26/03/2021, 09:50 - Paul: Also what else were you expecting from one of mistos forwards from grandma
26/03/2021, 09:50 - Wezz: Could also be some uneducated English born right wing retard.
26/03/2021, 09:51 - Paul: Jack?
26/03/2021, 09:51 - James: I don't think they know how to use computers beyond facebook
26/03/2021, 09:52 - Derren: what company is that for
26/03/2021, 09:53 - Wezz: Straight into the content, doesn't even notice.

Passed the test boys üëå someone get me a facebook group
26/03/2021, 09:57 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
26/03/2021, 09:58 - Paul: All this would be fixed if we demolished capitalism
26/03/2021, 10:00 - James: It would all be fixed if we demolished rebbit
26/03/2021, 10:00 - Wezz: The irony is, if you asked I believe the majority of liberals would agree with you üòÇ
26/03/2021, 10:05 - Wezz: For the record; I'm liberal. Just not, brain dribbling down the side of my face, haven't left echo chamber or house in 5 years, liberal.
26/03/2021, 10:09 - James: Classic libtard cope
26/03/2021, 10:10 - Wezz: I just want to fit in with my frieeenmbs
26/03/2021, 10:11 - Wezz: Good news is, fuck you all ü•∏
26/03/2021, 10:11 - James: I wonder what the honest anonymous average of this chat would be
26/03/2021, 10:11 - James: I think it's left leaning, with lots of right flavoured jokes
26/03/2021, 10:12 - Wezz: Oh defo left.
26/03/2021, 10:13 - Wezz: I think we could add Hitler in his prime and still have a left leaning chat
26/03/2021, 10:13 - James: Controversial opinion that Hitler was left wing, continue...
26/03/2021, 10:14 - Wezz: Horseshoe theory, we're almost there today.

26/03/2021, 10:18 - Wezz: Sorry, please. It was just a mistake
26/03/2021, 10:20 - James: No, no, it's okay, the council has deemed your actions that of an ally. Please report to the reparation rooms to donate only one mandatory organ of choice to the current fashionably supportable group of individuals.
26/03/2021, 10:25 - Wezz: _looks at daily oppressed rankings_

Not the Irish travellers again?! You saw what they did with the first half of my liver üôÑ

26/03/2021, 11:18 - Kirky: we have Jack noone here..
26/03/2021, 11:23 - Paul: Plus lockers supports BNP
26/03/2021, 11:24 - James: Who doesn't support Blingy Nipple Pasties?
26/03/2021, 11:27 - Paul: The BIG ARSE MAN ENERGY guys

26/03/2021, 11:34 - Wezz: Alright Sandra! Growing concerns of the lack of BIG ARSE MAN ENERGY representation within senior leadership positions? I agree!
26/03/2021, 11:36 - Mike: you wont want them mate, stuff theyve seen
26/03/2021, 11:37 - Paul: What even are these email groups. That would definitely turn me racist
26/03/2021, 11:39 - Mike: reverse mentoring always sounds funny, like they give you bad advice
26/03/2021, 11:40 - Paul: Thank God I'm in academia where thanks to affirmative action we're already over-diversified
26/03/2021, 11:40 - James: So what you're saying is DO eat yellow snow?
26/03/2021, 11:40 - Derren: Swallow it and it will fix you
26/03/2021, 11:41 - Wezz: üòÇ never thought of it like that. "So if you just stick a fork in that socket.."
26/03/2021, 11:41 - Wezz: "have a little cough on this old lady"
26/03/2021, 11:41 - Wezz: "How about a pub lunch today? Tequila?"
26/03/2021, 11:42 - Wezz: Well ever since I signed up to that one I think they think I'm black. Now I get _all the shit_
26/03/2021, 11:43 - Wezz: I made this hell apparently. Set up a filter already, in the bin
26/03/2021, 11:46 - Paul: Ah ok, so it's not like NHS or something, good
26/03/2021, 11:48 - Wezz: NHS stuff is a bit softer but still everywhere
26/03/2021, 11:48 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
26/03/2021, 11:50 - Wezz: Thing that's make me most racist. Is I work with loads of BAME, and when NHS came out with BAME people more vulnerable to COVID. The majority jumped on opportunity to work from home and impact of that is more work for others. But then now vaccine is here out of the 15% people who haven't got it in hospital, 90% are BAME
26/03/2021, 11:50 - Wezz: They can fuck right off and jump in the Thames
26/03/2021, 11:51 - Paul: Why would having a big arse make you more vulnerable to COVID?
26/03/2021, 11:52 - Wezz: So now my email has loads of "we're here to answer questions about covid vaccine" because pockets of retards who haven't integrated into society üëÄ
26/03/2021, 11:52 - Wezz: üòÇ
26/03/2021, 11:53 - Wezz: I know a few of them, hence my frustration
26/03/2021, 11:53 - Paul: Isn't this more of an NHS problem rather than BAME people?
26/03/2021, 11:55 - Wezz: Depends on the way you look at it I guess. But these people are just system abusers tbh. No one looks at them fondly for it. The study RE vulnerability of big arsed people failed to elaborate on social/economic factors e.g. 12 people living in a terrace house. Indians not letting their children leave the house til they're married all that kinda shit
26/03/2021, 11:56 - Wezz: So some of them sit on their big Indian arses coughing on each other while everyone else works harder. Fuck you ARJUN üòÇ
26/03/2021, 11:57 - Wezz: Not jealous, just want a big arse tbh
26/03/2021, 11:58 - Wezz: Sorry I meant *I AM* jealous.
26/03/2021, 12:04 - Paul: I just think most people would have taken the opportunity if it was given üòâ
26/03/2021, 12:05 - Paul: <Media omitted>
26/03/2021, 12:44 - Wezz: Well let's say I learnt I wasn't very racist. All the people I thought were lazy took the way out. All the others rolled their eyes. It's w/e just the reality behind these kinda things.

Defo agree with training/promotions though, I'd take all of it and encourage the good ones to do so.
26/03/2021, 13:03 - Piper: Hahaha
26/03/2021, 13:06 - Wezz: He's lost it. He's BaNaNaS
26/03/2021, 13:22 - Paul: üëèüëèüëè
26/03/2021, 14:03 - Paul: Wezz what time were you born?
26/03/2021, 14:04 - Mike: Be careful Wezz, the hesidic ginger can steal your name if you give him your time of birth
26/03/2021, 14:04 - Paul: I just want to know who's older and therefore wiser
26/03/2021, 14:17 - Wezz: One minute before you
26/03/2021, 14:17 - Wezz: I gave birth to you
26/03/2021, 14:17 - Wezz: Son.
26/03/2021, 14:17 - Paul: I don't think that's true ü§î
26/03/2021, 14:20 - Wezz: I googled hesidic, you mean Hasidic? Ginger still takes the cake of my concerns unless you educate me
26/03/2021, 14:22 - Wezz: The wisdom that comes with age is undermined by 10 years spent playing Counter Strike.
26/03/2021, 14:23 - Kirky: Only 10 years?
26/03/2021, 14:23 - Wezz: What's that quote; Eventlessness had no posts to drape duration. From nothing to nothing is no time at all
26/03/2021, 14:23 - Wezz: Don't talk about our dota2 hours üòÇ
26/03/2021, 14:24 - James: That's deep bro
26/03/2021, 14:24 - Wezz: Got it on my wall and everything, didn't need to google that one. had = has
26/03/2021, 14:25 - Wezz: Doesn't stop me playing MOBAs for thousands of hours üëå

26/03/2021, 15:15 - Noone: Mood
26/03/2021, 15:23 - Paul: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOS9KB2qoRI
26/03/2021, 15:36 - Wezz: He's tackling it front on now. Gotta love it. Still my favourite comedian just looking at content and not creepy jacking off Infront of women in hotel rooms
26/03/2021, 15:37 - Paul: I've read that there were also a few situations where he didn't get consent as well, which if true, are a bit of a downer
26/03/2021, 15:42 - Qck: Put down the phone bitch - Chappelle
26/03/2021, 15:42 - Paul: Yeah, it's a bit victim blame-y though isn't it.
26/03/2021, 15:42 - Paul: "How can you get cyber bullied - just walk away from PC"
26/03/2021, 15:43 - Qck: That's right, yes
26/03/2021, 15:43 - Wezz: Yeah, we'll literally never know the truth. But CBA, so much terrible stuff happens behind closed doors everywhere with people we value. I can enjoy someones content without caring about them as an individual, can also like individuals and hate their content. He's just the best comedian of last 10 years imo. Watched all his stuff and weighing it all up he can jack off in front of my daughter
26/03/2021, 15:43 - Paul: Super easy for a well adjusted adult, not so easy for a teenage kid whose friends all use social media constantly
26/03/2021, 15:44 - Qck: Teenagers are morons so that checks out
26/03/2021, 15:44 - Qck: And probably should be bullied for being so
26/03/2021, 15:44 - Paul: Yeah he's like my favourite comedian I wasn't trying to say otherwise
26/03/2021, 15:45 - Qck: Had some fem comedian bint at the knitting factory talk my head off after she had just got off stage about how Louis was a bad man, ended up missing a surprise Eric Andre appearance because of it
26/03/2021, 15:46 - Qck: So now I stand firmly on the side of the rapey man as she made me feel more uncomfortable than Louis' orange pecker would've
26/03/2021, 15:47 - Qck: New York Fem Comedian - nat even 1nce
26/03/2021, 15:47 - Wezz: Gotta keep things in context too. He ofc used his power, but he pathetically jacked off infront of women. Not rape.
26/03/2021, 15:48 - Wezz: It's embarrassing more than anything. They obviously were scared etc. But surely you can laugh at that at some point... idk.
26/03/2021, 15:49 - Wezz: What a weird fetish..
26/03/2021, 15:55 - Qck: Pretty sure he pushed a woman into a toilet cubicle to jack off on her, I think that's like one degree of separation from an actual rape
26/03/2021, 15:57 - Qck: From my own experience I think the woman has to push you into the cubicle to engage in that sort of thing, kinda like how you can't just put it in her ass you have to wait for the greenlight
26/03/2021, 16:00 - Mike: depends, what was she wearing at time of the event? Your honour, if she had ample cleavage my client was in fact the one who was sexually assaulted.\
26/03/2021, 16:04 - Wezz: Wish I got that last warning when I was 20, _shit everywhere_
26/03/2021, 16:07 - Wezz: Strife in speculation. I just assume he raped and murdered multiple people. Still like his comedy though.
26/03/2021, 16:40 - Paul: Yeah then the jokes he's making in the stand up are a bit disingenuous really
26/03/2021, 16:44 - Wezz: Can we ask for proof of the cubicle thing before we cast judgement. Google brings up nothing.
26/03/2021, 16:44 - Wezz: Also, it's Friday. YES
26/03/2021, 16:50 - Qck: It was part of his apology wasn't it? Where no woman mentioned it but he apologised for it and people were like "wait what's this toilet thing?"
26/03/2021, 16:50 - Piper: hahahahahaah
26/03/2021, 16:51 - Qck: Thanks Pipey

27/03/2021, 08:42 - Wezz: üòÇ
27/03/2021, 08:45 - Wezz: I vaguely remember playing that spelling game where you run on the letters. I was being SO CAREFUL not to run on any letters that weren't the ones I needed. Only to find out when you press space your character headbutts the ground like some neanderthal and my exactitude was completely unnecessary.

That was enough for me to alt-f4 that SHIT GAME. Going to refund it right now.
27/03/2021, 08:46 - Wezz: The car game I had to press some shit button to accelerate. The one where you run hold D and takes you half the game to find out which character you are cause everyone's doing the same? What a pile of shit
27/03/2021, 08:47 - Wezz: Going to copy paste that as my _reason for refund_
27/03/2021, 08:56 - James: Jesus Christ man
27/03/2021, 10:19 - Mike: People on lol Reddit getting angry about new character being the same anime waifu as the last ten characters lol
27/03/2021, 10:22 - Wezz: Was reading that üòÇ more that she was a puppet or something? Which is same lore as Oriana. So they changed and made her like everyone else lol

27/03/2021, 10:27 - Noone: You made all that in s night?
27/03/2021, 10:28 - Mike: Actually wezz she's a doll made human, vastly different to a puppet brought to life like Shaco. Or a doll made into a robot. Like Orianna.

Until we pass out. Get enough people we'll do in house games.

Thanks fuck you

Sam
30/03/2021, 15:00 - Kirky: No thanks I dont like getting drunk and playing league
30/03/2021, 15:01 - Kirky: I'm gonna read Nietzsche and drink water
30/03/2021, 15:04 - Mike: On my father's death bed he turned to me and said "Son, if you don't get to plat your inheritance will donated to Save The Gays". I'm not sure Save The Gays is a real charity but I can't take that risk, see you Thursday.
30/03/2021, 15:07 - Wezz: I tried to make the invite as sad as possible, but it just sounds awesome to me.
30/03/2021, 15:07 - Wezz: ‚ÄúWithout league, life would be a mistake.‚Äù - Nietzsche
30/03/2021, 15:09 - Wezz: Good luck getting to plat with a bunch of drunk idiots - our hatred for gays might bring us together
30/03/2021, 15:53 - Derren: <Media omitted>
30/03/2021, 15:57 - James: Nice magnum dong
30/03/2021, 15:57 - Dayle: Yeah amazing init, with all that space you should invest in a massive yurt and make a lan yurt
30/03/2021, 15:59 - Lockers: TIL what a yurt is
30/03/2021, 16:25 - Kirky: How do you have a garden that big in London?
30/03/2021, 16:26 - Derren: I live in zone 6
30/03/2021, 16:26 - Kirky: That means nothing to me

30/03/2021, 18:00 - Kirky: Underlying health condition
30/03/2021, 18:00 - Kirky: Tumor shit

30/03/2021, 18:09 - Derren: Autism level 20
30/03/2021, 18:10 - Lockers: Oh yeah, OK thats fair then glad you're a little safer xoxo
30/03/2021, 18:11 - Kirky: thanks babe i dont feel any safer, i never had to shield or anything. if anything i feel worse cause my ARM HURTS
30/03/2021, 18:12 - James: Amputate

30/03/2021, 18:18 - Derren: üò¢
30/03/2021, 18:27 - Wezz: Scientific name for it.
30/03/2021, 18:27 - Wezz: I regularly tell our patients, sorry sir you've got tumor shit going on. Want a cup of tea?
30/03/2021, 18:28 - Lockers: Could have told kirky earlier on
30/03/2021, 18:28 - Wezz: GRATZ
30/03/2021, 18:32 - Wezz: You could have educated him about the importance of health and wellbeing in school...somehow
30/03/2021, 18:51 - Paul: Autism causes vaccines
30/03/2021, 18:55 - Dayle: Yeah listen to this vaccinated individual
30/03/2021, 19:35 - Piper: <Media omitted>
30/03/2021, 19:35 - Wezz: OH SHIT
30/03/2021, 19:35 - Wezz: That looks super cool
30/03/2021, 19:37 - Paul: You idiot. It's only got 1 wheel. How's that gonna work
30/03/2021, 19:41 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
30/03/2021, 19:41 - Wezz: He thinks he has free choice.

30/03/2021, 20:26 - Dayle: THE FUCKING WORST WHAT
30/03/2021, 23:08 - Dayle: right im back whos gaymen?

31/03/2021, 08:49 - Mike: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-56585538
31/03/2021, 09:00 - Wezz: None of this particularly surprising but nice to see the numbers üëç
31/03/2021, 09:01 - Wezz: Love the last point;

But some communities continue to be "haunted" by historic racism, which is creating "deep mistrust" and could be a barrier to success

Intrigued what numbers they have supporting that statement. Strums my banjo
31/03/2021, 09:03 - Derren: Classic victim mentality
31/03/2021, 09:04 - Paul: So many concerns over vaccine safety here atm
31/03/2021, 09:04 - Lockers: Oh?
31/03/2021, 09:04 - Wezz: It's the authors sticking their fingers up and putting their tongues out in the Discussion section I'm sure. But be nice if it's supported by something.
31/03/2021, 09:04 - Paul: They've stopped under 60 women from having astrazeneca
31/03/2021, 09:05 - Paul: New data showing a lot more blood clots
31/03/2021, 09:05 - Wezz: Following this pretty closely.
31/03/2021, 09:05 - Lockers: Enlighten us Sam
31/03/2021, 09:05 - Paul: When I say a lot more. It's still tiny numbers. But it's almost certainly linked at this point
31/03/2021, 09:06 - Lockers: UNDER 60?
31/03/2021, 09:06 - Wezz: Huge political confounders here. Cause UK taking all the AZ vaccines, Europe getting fucked
31/03/2021, 09:06 - Lockers: Thought the data showed the opposite
31/03/2021, 09:06 - Wezz: It's a very rare platelet issue can cause clot in brain. But we're talking super small numbers.
31/03/2021, 09:06 - Wezz: Original was like 35 in 1.7mil?
31/03/2021, 09:07 - Paul: Yup. The age group 23-55 for women reported like 21 new clots this week so they've paused it
31/03/2021, 09:07 - Paul: Same in Norway apparently
31/03/2021, 09:08 - Paul: I've seen a few people suggesting it could be birth control related which makes sense for the demographic
31/03/2021, 09:08 - Paul: But that's just speculation ofc
31/03/2021, 09:09 - Wezz: Same countries that did the initial freeze that was then revoked after EMA and WHO gave their statements
31/03/2021, 09:10 - James: Well birth control has its own blood clot issues right? A lot of the counter arguments I've seen is about how nobody is worried about the blood clot risk of contraceptives, but as soon as it's something for everyone there is worries.
31/03/2021, 09:10 - Lockers: I thought that this was lower than the general population as well as those already on the pill
31/03/2021, 09:10 - Paul: It's causing a lot of confusion and fear. People don't trust it now. It's also really pushing the antivax agenda
31/03/2021, 09:11 - Wezz: Well it's incredibly convenient for the government as they have ZERO STOCK
31/03/2021, 09:11 - Wezz: Well, they have the Belgium lab stock. But it's not a lot.
31/03/2021, 09:11 - Paul: Nah the numbers expected for this platelet clot is like 1 per week but it was like 5 per week on average or something
31/03/2021, 09:11 - James: It's also not like antivax need anything to scream and get attention about
31/03/2021, 09:13 - Paul: So there's now discussion over what's safer for that age group. Still probably the vaccine. But if you factor in that you're not guaranteed to get covid then it becomes more complicated
31/03/2021, 09:16 - James: You could make it simpler by forcing everyone to get covid
31/03/2021, 09:17 - Lockers: Yeeee boiiii
31/03/2021, 09:18 - Mike: Don't worry we're pretty much on that path
31/03/2021, 09:23 - Wezz: What we need during a vaccine rollout is some political uncertainty. That presser with Merkel, your health sec says "this is precautionary" then Merkel's like WE WILL PROTECT THE PEOPLE AT ALL COSTS.
31/03/2021, 09:23 - Wezz: She was first to suppor thte eu vaccine export ban when UK got priority on AZ contracts
31/03/2021, 09:23 - Wezz: Lots of behind the scenes ¬£¬£ that's important to follow
31/03/2021, 09:27 - Lockers: How does one follow this part though?
31/03/2021, 09:29 - Wezz: Contracts and supply. We got two labs making AZ in UK. Two others in EU.
31/03/2021, 09:30 - Wezz: EU vs UK contract issues prob most relevant; e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQpQKCFRGo0
31/03/2021, 09:32 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
31/03/2021, 09:32 - Wezz: But that's just me...
31/03/2021, 09:33 - Paul: Interesting so is the implication that EU is angry with astrazeneca and so deliberately exaggerating the concerns to cause public opinion to go south?
31/03/2021, 09:33 - Wezz: definitely happened the first time round until the EMA got involved
31/03/2021, 09:33 - Paul: This is an angle I hadn't considered
31/03/2021, 09:35 - Wezz: But not read all the new data on cerebral embolism, except there's lots of data showing DVT->PE rate is mirroring general population (this is BIG DATA since UK pretty decent at collecting and roll out). And in some the vaccinated group < than control group. Then you have the Wales study of 180,000 AZ presenting 0 blood clots
31/03/2021, 09:36 - Paul: Christ this just makes it even harder to know who to trust
31/03/2021, 09:36 - Paul: What a disaster
31/03/2021, 09:37 - Wezz: Lots of upset EU health secs talking about the original AZ contract on news stations, you can see how pissed they are at UK stealing priority. IMO was definitely cause for the first suspension, they simply couldn't get supply
31/03/2021, 09:37 - Wezz: Relieves public backlash
31/03/2021, 09:37 - Wezz: etc
31/03/2021, 09:39 - Paul: But they are at the same time sowing a lot of mistrust for constantly rubber banding on their decisions. I wouldn't think they'd do that deliberately. It makes them look incompetent
31/03/2021, 09:40 - James: Yeah, but that's assuming they're not incompetent
31/03/2021, 09:41 - Lockers: Politicians are never ever incompetent
31/03/2021, 09:42 - Paul: Half of politics is convincing people that it's all under control lol
31/03/2021, 09:42 - Wezz: IMO they're negotiating supply with AZ behind the scenes. First delivery didn't come through (UK got theirs) hence the initial presser suspending vaccine across Europe. EMA said vaccine is safe. First delivery comes in don't hear anything for 4 weeks. Supply demand not met by AZ for the second time -> we're only using it on over 60s
31/03/2021, 09:43 - Wezz: Could just be my conspiracy hat, but that's how I see it.
31/03/2021, 09:43 - Paul: Do they do payments in batches then? Why would astrazeneca care who is being vaccinated they get paid either way surely
31/03/2021, 09:47 - Wezz: it's the wording in the contracts supposedly. EU released a redacted contract showing they had x demands, AZ said they can't meet those demands due to Belgium lab production being less than expected. EU (Merkel) threatened to halt EU exportation of all vaccines.
31/03/2021, 09:48 - Wezz: The wording was "best reasonable efforts" behind the delivery of targets. AZ says they tried, EU says they didn't
31/03/2021, 09:48 - Wezz: UK got order in 3 months ealier than EU
31/03/2021, 09:48 - Wezz: Cue drama
31/03/2021, 09:52 - Lockers: More important
31/03/2021, 10:12 - Paul: Hmm interesting
31/03/2021, 10:13 - Paul: Thanks for the info
31/03/2021, 10:13 - Lockers: UK news reporting this loads
31/03/2021, 10:18 - Kirky: <Media omitted>
31/03/2021, 11:46 - Wezz: Gotta catch some rays while I can
31/03/2021, 11:52 - Wezz: Yeah I'm sure the truth is somewhere in the middle. But majorly political whichever way you look at it.
31/03/2021, 14:21 - Wezz: My prediction:
Germany will lift the restriction on <60's by 30th June 2021 (once they've received their AZ vaccine backlog).
31/03/2021, 17:03 - Dayle: whos up for some boring sober gaming :D

01/04/2021, 11:35 - Wezz: Was hoping April Fools tbh

01/04/2021, 11:50 - James: I thought you were going to ask what age was the youngest you'd knock them out
01/04/2021, 11:52 - Wezz: Also this @447758520258
01/04/2021, 11:57 - Mike: We're sending through our first delivery order through nandos own app today, majority of the work I've been doing for them.

If it succeeds were celebrate hard with much alcohol tonight. If it fails we commiserate hard with much alcohol tonight.
01/04/2021, 11:58 - Kirky: Are you in a line for a big bonus if it all goes well ?
01/04/2021, 11:59 - Mike: Not even half a chicken üêì

01/04/2021, 12:01 - Mike: If (user ===bummer) chicken.cost = free

01/04/2021, 13:08 - Kirky: Do year 9s ask the most questions?

01/04/2021, 13:25 - James: Considering kinder means child, I'm gonna have to say it's no longer a kinder surprise

07/04/2021, 10:34 - James: They pushed this bullshit in sixth form, saying that mispronouncing someone's name for long enough was bullying, so for the last 8 or so years we've called our friend Sam Smam, just to prove it wasn't bullying. I don't know anyone who still calls him Sam.
07/04/2021, 10:37 - Mike: Why not Spam?
07/04/2021, 10:41 - Lockers: Spam is always the go to for Sam, because then you can hit them on the head
07/04/2021, 10:42 - Mike: My sister's nickname is spam, mostly because she had a big forehead
07/04/2021, 10:42 - Mike: Its universal
07/04/2021, 10:43 - James: Spam has other meanings, this was just to prove that calling someone something meaningless isn't inherently bullying
07/04/2021, 10:46 - Alex: Oh, is that why we call him smam? I didnt even know üòÇ
07/04/2021, 10:49 - James: Yeah, it was a Moxham assembly that inspired it

07/04/2021, 11:59 - Mike: Friend at was messaging another friend about a joint call they were on, the recipient friend starting screensharing and showed the conversation to everyone. Including the manager they were being really mean to regarding her voice lol
07/04/2021, 11:59 - Mike: Work*
07/04/2021, 12:10 - James: The most awkward moment I've had at work was a call with someone I'd not really worked with before and was asking his team to do something for me, but I could hear a drag of a vape pen every so often. I messaged a friend on the same call saying "BRO DO YOU EVEN VAPE ON CALLS?!". The guy then immediately said "James, you know you're sharing your screen to us right?"

07/04/2021, 15:15 - Wezz: I think I could get behind the blind corporate belief in our products. As opposed to the weird guilt driven enforcement in healthcare. Ima start recommending them to eat Nandos and get over their fear of sexual condemnation

07/04/2021, 17:36 - Qck: Still good, his commencement speech and Charlie Rose(?) interview is still quintessential YouTube viewing for the budding autist
07/04/2021, 17:44 - Wezz: Saw the commencement speech, haven't seen Charlie Rose.
07/04/2021, 17:46 - Wezz: Reminded me of a fat bearded spoken poetry guy I used to love around that time, he had some great passionate bits on prejudice etc.
07/04/2021, 17:47 - Wezz: Ironically (but fortunately), Google found him when I searched fat bearded spoken word; *Shane Koyczan*.
07/04/2021, 17:47 - Wezz: This was the Shane one that blew up; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltun92DfnPY

He's got some other great live ones though.

07/04/2021, 18:11 - Qck: I think the audio version of his essay "Consider the Lobster" gives you an idea if you can be assed reading things like Infinite Jest etc.
07/04/2021, 18:23 - Wezz: I already get shit for Peterson's lobster allusions, can't be doubling down.

Just listened to a 5 min clip on YouTube and seems like more of the same rustled jimmies x superiority complex spoken word. Think I consumed enough of that in my angsty youth to shoot up a school.

09/04/2021, 09:43 - Derren: Then how will you ever experience everything the world has to offer!
09/04/2021, 09:43 - James: Nah because if I'd like it then I'd like it and then I wouldn't avoid it

09/04/2021, 12:27 - Mike: Must have run out of virgins because of covid
09/04/2021, 12:28 - Wezz: I only watch movies that I like, haven't seen a bad one yet.

Only watched Scooby Doo: Curse of the Lake Monster.

_30 years_
09/04/2021, 12:32 - Wezz: Louis CK does a bit on this in his new special.

Getting 72 virgins in heaven, then fucking them in first few weeks and only being left with " 72 hoes" üòÇ

Such a weird archaic appeal to human tendency. We just gloss over that shit.

09/04/2021, 12:39 - Lockers: and 5G
09/04/2021, 12:48 - Lockers: Here's hoping for a bank holiday Monday to mourn his passing
09/04/2021, 12:53 - Paul: Hello
09/04/2021, 12:55 - Dayle: Hello
09/04/2021, 13:11 - James: Paul aren't you supposed to be off of your phone?
09/04/2021, 13:11 - James: What would Julia think?
09/04/2021, 13:11 - Paul: It's over now
09/04/2021, 13:12 - Dayle: phone ban?
09/04/2021, 13:12 - Paul: We took a social media break for a week
09/04/2021, 13:15 - Derren: Could you still play games?
09/04/2021, 13:16 - Paul: I mean I could but I didn't
09/04/2021, 13:20 - Piper: no wonder i havent seen you about
09/04/2021, 13:20 - Lockers: Don't pretend you noticed
09/04/2021, 13:21 - Lockers: Lockers: You seen Paul?
pipes: hoo?
Lockers: Wow dude, that's not nice
pipes: fake logs
09/04/2021, 13:21 - Piper: seriously i looked at this chat and saw pauls name without seeing the context - and was going to say pauls gone AWOL - but instead the reason was given
09/04/2021, 13:22 - Piper: God giveth
09/04/2021, 13:22 - Piper: and took away
09/04/2021, 13:22 - Paul: Anyone gaming tonight?
09/04/2021, 13:22 - Piper: yes
09/04/2021, 13:22 - Lockers: Yeah boi it's LoL and SHOTS NIGHT LETS GO WOOOO
09/04/2021, 13:23 - Paul: ‚òπÔ∏è
09/04/2021, 13:23 - Paul: Guess I can play some realm royale
09/04/2021, 13:23 - Lockers: Gr8 game that
09/04/2021, 13:25 - Paul: Most important news is that I got unbanned from /r/socialism
09/04/2021, 13:26 - Lockers: dejavu
09/04/2021, 13:28 - Dayle: anti fucking leaguers disgust me
09/04/2021, 13:29 - Paul: You accidentally put anti at the start there
09/04/2021, 13:30 - Dayle: just as bad as antifa
09/04/2021, 13:30 - Piper: gauranteed dayle will say i fucking hate lol times tonight
09/04/2021, 13:31 - Paul: Yeah man fuck being anti fascist. I'd rather be the opposite... wait
09/04/2021, 13:31 - Mike: imagine poor little monkey explaining to his friends he can control things with his mind, I doubt he even has the vocabulary needed for it? Whats the macaque screech for Elon you reckon?
09/04/2021, 13:32 - Paul: I think it's just throwing faeces at him.
09/04/2021, 13:32 - Lockers: What a load of shit you've just written
09/04/2021, 13:32 - Dayle: my guy elon will jab you in the throat mate
09/04/2021, 13:34 - Kirky: Is WhatsApp social media ?
09/04/2021, 13:34 - Paul: Kinda?
09/04/2021, 13:36 - Lockers: Technically I think so as you can have a profile and a status
09/04/2021, 13:40 - Paul: Wouldn't social media be more defined as media that you socialise with? Socialised media platforms where the main purpose was to socialise
09/04/2021, 13:40 - Lockers: no
09/04/2021, 14:07 - Dayle: hurry up 5 o clock
09/04/2021, 14:07 - Dayle: i wanna get some shots in me
09/04/2021, 14:28 - Noone: Don't even get a day off ffs
09/04/2021, 14:29 - Noone: No
09/04/2021, 14:29 - Noone: Shut the fuck up you lovely man
09/04/2021, 14:33 - Wezz: Emails?
09/04/2021, 14:34 - Wezz: This is so accurate I felt ashamed, then immediately excited that it's Friday
09/04/2021, 14:34 - Dayle: I wanna get a proper nice shot drink tonight im trying to find that AU vodka but i dont think anywhere sells it in shops
09/04/2021, 14:35 - James: I think it's a blurry line. I would argue that it's about purpose. Whatsapp started as a messenger, but added photos, statuses, group chats. I'd classify it under social media if I were talking about it.
09/04/2021, 14:38 - Dayle: whatsapp is about as social media is for iMessenger.. its a social communications platform, dont get it confused with a media sharing platform - Albeit you can share gifs and videos, would you class Discord as social media?
09/04/2021, 14:38 - Paul: It depends on what definition you use. Like I guess emails and even phone calls are technically social media if you're using a broader term of socialised media
09/04/2021, 14:38 - Wezz: Stick a blindfold on for a week üëå
09/04/2021, 14:39 - Paul: Then it's the distinction between platforms, networks, devices etc
09/04/2021, 14:39 - Wezz: Interested to know why you guys decided to do it? Did you track anything during the week? Notice anything?
09/04/2021, 14:40 - James: At the risk of sound like I'm giving a wedding speech:
Oxford defines social media as websites and applications that enable users to create and share content or to participate in social networking.
09/04/2021, 14:40 - James: I'd argue messengers still fit that category.
09/04/2021, 14:42 - Lockers: Cheers James, knew you'd have my back
09/04/2021, 14:42 - Paul: We did a lot of reading and cooking. Planned a bunch of hiking and outdoors stuff but then had a blizzard for 3 straight days lol. We bought some puzzles and did them like old people. Watched a bunch of movies. Was actually really nice tbh. Also spent 3 days at her mum's for Easter and went on some long walks with the dogs.

I didn't really miss it that much tbh. The biggest difference was definitely that we felt more aware of boredom and free time. Couldn't just instantly pick up your phone in those quiet moments.
09/04/2021, 14:42 - Lockers: Now fuck off you ginger cunt
09/04/2021, 14:42 - Wezz: Yeah definition is majorly broad, but i totally agree there's nuance. For me at least, platforms that encourage comparison of yourself with others are most responsible for psych damage
09/04/2021, 14:42 - Wezz: I guess that summarises into, anything that tracks levels of engagements to posts.
09/04/2021, 14:43 - Wezz: E.g. likes, comments, w/e
09/04/2021, 14:43 - James: In some people, for me Whatsapp is a great tool to remind me how things could be worse
09/04/2021, 14:43 - Paul: Whereas Instagram is about reminding you how it could be better
09/04/2021, 14:53 - James: I don't know what you mean, I live a perfect life
09/04/2021, 15:06 - Dayle: Is that because you watch us do shots and have a great time? Tad judgemental phillip ü§£üçÜüçÜ
09/04/2021, 15:09 - James: I've seen Kirky by 10pm, it puts things in perspective

09/04/2021, 15:25 - Kirky: I'm the fastest shot in the west

11/04/2021, 14:46 - James: It's salt and sugar wrapped in self loathing and sometimes you need to fuel a lazy day
11/04/2021, 14:54 - James: That's fair, McDs is pretty low on my list of takeaways for sure, but it's something we have every now and again

12/04/2021, 22:19 - Nathan: Haha so a normal lockdown day then? ü§£ü§£
12/04/2021, 22:19 - Nathan: I feel you man, 1.5 hour time slots is not enough time to get drunk in!
12/04/2021, 22:20 - Lockers: You say that but I've played football against a bunch of idiots who can't handle their drink tonight
12/04/2021, 22:21 - Nathan: I mean playing sober vs a load of drunks is low man
12/04/2021, 22:21 - Lockers: Anything to get the win, ya know?

13/04/2021, 12:02 - Kirky: I'll do my first shot in a pub in chat anyway
13/04/2021, 12:02 - Kirky: I dont know how to not do them in chat anymore
13/04/2021, 12:03 - Kirky: Pulling my phone out to record it is ingrained in my soul at this point
13/04/2021, 12:03 - Piper: We all going to record doing shot and sending it to chat whilst sitting at the same round table in the pub?
13/04/2021, 12:04 - Piper: Think its a must
13/04/2021, 12:07 - Nathan: Why are you so shapist? Why can't the table be square or rectangular or triangular, why does it have to be round? Can we all agree to call it an item holding apparatus
13/04/2021, 12:09 - Piper: Cause we are knights
13/04/2021, 12:28 - Wezz: Piper's a genius, prove me wrong.
13/04/2021, 12:49 - Piper: most noble of you sir big dong
13/04/2021, 13:14 - Wezz: _flops massive dong on *round* table_

I don't question your commands Sir Girthy Pipe, fore my dong is too large and tiring for such indecision.
13/04/2021, 13:18 - Wezz: Leave it to Sir Hap Penis to bring forth doubt in the shape of our communal dick stool.
13/04/2021, 16:14 - Dayle: So can we meet up with each other end of the month and get fucking blasted please IRL?

13/04/2021, 16:27 - Dayle: well fuck it we just all converge to your house :D
13/04/2021, 16:29 - Qck: You're only drinking lemonades if we do meet up at the pub

13/04/2021, 17:17 - Derren: How do you get entertainment from watching sports?
13/04/2021, 17:18 - Lockers: But that's not single player or the same thing
13/04/2021, 17:18 - Derren: You're judging what I find entertaining, I didn't watch the whole thing, just heard about it, it's cool to see how mechanically skilled people are
13/04/2021, 17:20 - Lockers: Yeah ok I get that, but in v small doses
13/04/2021, 18:45 - Dayle: we gaym
13/04/2021, 19:07 - Paul: Did you forget where you are?

13/04/2021, 19:38 - Kirky: Shot per order
13/04/2021, 19:40 - Wezz: Hope it's Uber Eats and I'm not bankrupting some poor Asian family :(
13/04/2021, 19:40 - Wezz: If I know anything about Uber; it's that they like to pass liability
13/04/2021, 19:40 - Wezz: Do I really need to say "I'm in" at this point?
13/04/2021, 22:22 - Noone: I'm coming for piper
13/04/2021, 22:26 - Wezz: You're disgusting.
13/04/2021, 22:27 - Noone: New movie
It's the story of misto and lockers. How lockers was a fan of mistos CS plays back in the day, but as he gets older he realises misto isn't the god he looked up to. In time his skills begin to rival his sensei. They both join separate teams. Misto has to choose between his eSports future and his life on the roads, all the while moving further and further from the expectations of his deeply religious Muslim parents. Jack has to overcome his own demons, including his drinking problem.
In the end the two are leading their respective teams in a CS:GO grand major final.
13/04/2021, 22:29 - Noone: Misto takes game one, lockers falling prey to the plays he'd idolised years prior. Lockers has a moment of self doubt, and overcomes misto and his team in game two, exploiting mistos growing hubris
13/04/2021, 22:30 - Noone: At the dawn of round three both can be seen glaring at eachother from across the stage, the crowd goes mental as the screens show the final map. cs_office.
13/04/2021, 22:30 - Dayle: Happy Ramadan for anyone who celebrates it x
13/04/2021, 22:31 - Noone: Shut up Dayle I'm busy
13/04/2021, 22:31 - Lockers: DAYLE WE JUST GOT TO THE THIRD MAP
13/04/2021, 22:32 - Noone: It's a constant back and forth.
The game pushes into overtime.
Viewership of the twitch stream caps out at 800 million viewers. Twitch dedicate an entire server farm just to keep the chat moving
13/04/2021, 22:33 - Noone: In the final moments of the pivotal round, misto makes a critical error in the projection room. Lockers has already snagged the hostage from the lounge.
It's a mad dash, misto sprays at lockers from the hallway, lockers narrowly avoiding the hail of gunfire. He knows mistos spray control.
13/04/2021, 22:35 - Noone: Lockers makes It to the outside, twenty more steps and he's taken the win. Misto sees him from the shattered glass window, just as lockers slips out of view.



But the game doesn't end
13/04/2021, 22:35 - Noone: Lockers stands from his chair. His team staring in amazement as he drops the mouse from his still curled fingers
13/04/2021, 22:36 - Noone: He looks up across the stage. Tears in his eyes, directly Into mistos soul.
Misto stares back
13/04/2021, 22:37 - Noone: They both stumble out of their respective team booths. The crowd is silent. Lockers character on the display, motionless as they embrace eachother silloetted by the game that had turned them into enemies
13/04/2021, 22:37 - Noone: Roll credits
13/04/2021, 22:38 - Derren: What did you smoke
13/04/2021, 22:38 - Lockers: That was fucking beautiful man, crying now
13/04/2021, 22:39 - Lockers: This man clearly hasn't seen the funeral 2 @447588936693
13/04/2021, 22:39 - Noone: In the director's cut you wave dash into Locker's arms
13/04/2021, 22:40 - Derren: I can't wavedash but I can bhop
13/04/2021, 22:40 - Lockers: Remember that time you tried to bhop irl
13/04/2021, 22:41 - Derren: I have tried many times :(
13/04/2021, 22:41 - Derren: <Media omitted>
14/04/2021, 08:38 - Paul: That was beautiful ü•≤
14/04/2021, 08:40 - Wezz: All that greentext writing finally paying off üòé
14/04/2021, 09:08 - Noone: <Media omitted>
14/04/2021, 09:23 - Lockers: So you have to spend nearly ¬£30 each?
14/04/2021, 09:24 - Noone: Minimum for 2 people
14/04/2021, 09:25 - James: So ¬£75 each + another ¬£10 in tip?
14/04/2021, 09:36 - Paul: I don't even know how you could spend that much even with a full meal and whole night of drinks
14/04/2021, 09:36 - James: Well it is LANDAN
14/04/2021, 09:37 - Paul: Yeah I suppose. I don't blame them really when they've been shut all year they've got the demand for it
14/04/2021, 09:37 - Mike: everywhere I've looked at is booked for weeks on fridays/saturdays
14/04/2021, 09:37 - Mike: Sundays seem possible though
14/04/2021, 09:56 - Dayle: FYI spoons is first come first serve
14/04/2021, 09:56 - Dayle: You don't book i don't think you don't with the one here
14/04/2021, 09:56 - Dayle: We could pub crawl spoons
14/04/2021, 09:57 - Dayle: Bruv this is the most paulish thing I have ever seen - :)
14/04/2021, 10:01 - Wezz: I'm in no rush to go from a 14¬£ bottle of vodka to 14¬£ per drink. I vote park day in the sun
14/04/2021, 10:02 - Dayle: Second that let's go
14/04/2021, 10:14 - Derren: Only sensible boy here
14/04/2021, 11:07 - Paul: What bar are you going to where you're spending 75 quid? Even if you have a 20 quid meal? A beer is like 4 quid are you buying 14 beers? That's a hell of a night out
14/04/2021, 12:24 - Dayle: Nailed the Greek lunch :)
14/04/2021, 12:24 - Dayle: <Media omitted>
14/04/2021, 12:24 - Nathan: I'm only a simple northerner with simple prices but that sounds like the cost of a place in Manchester... assuming you're talking more like 40 for food and 6 a pint
14/04/2021, 12:26 - James: Yeah, no way are you getting a pint of anything worth drinking in London for ¬£4
14/04/2021, 12:28 - Paul: 40 per person for food? Wtf are you eating
14/04/2021, 12:30 - James: If it's not spoons that's pretty easily done with a 3 course meal
14/04/2021, 12:31 - Paul: Why are you getting a 3 course meal in a pub
14/04/2021, 12:32 - James: Oh yeah, I suppose, I was thinking restaurants as well but that picture does clearly say bar table
14/04/2021, 12:32 - James: I'll jump on the bandwagon if there's room Paul
14/04/2021, 12:32 - Paul: Damn right
14/04/2021, 12:33 - Dayle: I'll buy 40 quids worth of chicken wings
14/04/2021, 12:33 - Lockers: You're definitely underestimating
14/04/2021, 12:34 - James: What bar was this for Jack?
14/04/2021, 12:35 - Wezz: I wasn't even thinking food beyond a 10er. Drinks would be 6¬£ a pint x5. Few rounds of shots mixed in. Probably 60 quid each to get wrecked + eat wings.
14/04/2021, 12:36 - Paul: Like 75-100 I could easily spend on a night out in London but that would include entrance and taxi
14/04/2021, 12:36 - Paul: Not just for drinks and food that's mental to me
14/04/2021, 12:36 - James: You can't buy a taxi for ¬£100 Paul
14/04/2021, 12:36 - James: The license to run it alone would be in the thousands
14/04/2021, 12:37 - Paul: No you're wrong
14/04/2021, 12:37 - James: Prove me wrong
14/04/2021, 12:37 - Paul: Just did
14/04/2021, 12:38 - James: Bake him away toys
14/04/2021, 12:39 - Paul: 6 quid + for a beer is a joke btw. Get a litre at Oktoberfest for 11 and that's considered expensive
14/04/2021, 12:39 - James: Yeah but then you need to live in the Fatherland
14/04/2021, 12:40 - Qck: Even if the beer was free I'd never betray my country
14/04/2021, 12:45 - Dayle: Thats 5.25 a pint Paul gtfo
14/04/2021, 12:54 - Wezz: Yeah I say ¬£6 assuming opportunist pubs post lockdown. London pubs were average ~¬£4.50 a pint pre (I'd guess)
14/04/2021, 12:56 - Paul: Everyone come to Germany its way better
14/04/2021, 12:57 - Qck: Except judging by Wezz and Dayle's excellent economic analysis it's not?
14/04/2021, 12:58 - Wezz: But there're Germans there
14/04/2021, 12:58 - Paul: They mostly stay out of the way when they see the British knobs coming along
14/04/2021, 13:27 - Piper: Money Money Money
14/04/2021, 13:27 - Piper: i have laodsa money
14/04/2021, 13:56 - Nathan: I mean you're talking 4.50 for a coors/peroni up in Manchester. Maybe carling is that down there
14/04/2021, 14:00 - James: Yeah, it's easily ¬£6 for a Peroni here, let alone and London uplift
14/04/2021, 14:03 - Paul: Expensive beer, grey sky's and rain and you can't even keep your princes  alive? God what a shithole
14/04/2021, 14:03 - Kirky: Bought 2 pints of peroni for ¬£18 at pauls a German party
14/04/2021, 14:03 - Kirky: You're welcome free
14/04/2021, 14:03 - Kirky: Drew
14/04/2021, 14:05 - Dayle: you lost 2 wars with us you fucking german cunt watch your mouth :D
14/04/2021, 14:05 - Dayle: Haha speaking of german cunts when we going to visit :P
14/04/2021, 14:10 - Derren: WHEN IS THE WEDDING MATE
14/04/2021, 14:11 - Paul: No see here's the beauty of it. I'm on England's side when Germany is wrong and visa versa
14/04/2021, 14:11 - Dayle: yeah when is the wedding cant wait for that :D
14/04/2021, 14:11 - Dayle: Ahh OK - gottcha
14/04/2021, 14:14 - Paul: Much like Alex is with the French I guess. Except when the French are wrong he just surrenders LOL
14/04/2021, 14:16 - Derren: When are the French right?
14/04/2021, 14:20 - Paul: They had the right idea with that revolution, but poor follow through
14/04/2021, 14:25 - Dayle: my cars french - it puts warning lights on when its cold or sad.. its rather defeatist
14/04/2021, 14:44 - James: A French car should be good right? You want it to  get out of there fast if you put your foot down
14/04/2021, 15:02 - Wezz: Woah, I didn't know we were talking Peroni's here
14/04/2021, 15:03 - James: COME ON WEZZ, I THOUGHT YOU WERE A MAN OF TASTE
14/04/2021, 15:04 - Wezz: Gotta play both sides of the field for sure üëå having your German Stollen and using it as a door stop I see
14/04/2021, 15:04 - Wezz: No one eats that shit right?

14/04/2021, 15:27 - Paul: Lets not get ahead of ourselves, Jack is a shit teacher
14/04/2021, 15:29 - Lockers: Awww shucks, fanx m8
14/04/2021, 15:29 - Wezz: Still has to babysit 30 kids
14/04/2021, 15:30 - Wezz: I'd charge ¬£20 per kid. That's ¬£600 a day ~ ¬£12k per month = woefully underpaid
14/04/2021, 15:33 - Paul: Fuck Jack
14/04/2021, 15:34 - Paul: He should pay them
14/04/2021, 15:34 - Wezz: Oh I get it now ü§≠
14/04/2021, 15:45 - Noone: It wasn't for some ritzy place it was for our local in Paddington
14/04/2021, 15:45 - Noone: So no way any sane individual is spending 75 which is why we all thought it was ridiculous
14/04/2021, 15:46 - James: Paddington, like the bear?
14/04/2021, 15:46 - James: Sounds pretty ritzy to me
14/04/2021, 15:46 - Noone: Meanwhile, the other local has invested in fuck loads of outdoor seating and offering discounts on beers and shit to celebrate
14/04/2021, 15:46 - Noone: Yeah Paddington like the bear but also the place but also the bear with me and I will be in the future internet connection is a good time to get the latest flash player is required for video playback is unavailable right now because this video

14/04/2021, 22:22 - James: "Help us, our media is becoming obsolete due to more convenient online options. I know, lets make the worst online experience possible in order to recapture our audience"
14/04/2021, 22:24 - Mike: I hope she contacts Edris and makes him apologise for not going all out caricature black so we could feast on his diverse meal choices in the show
14/04/2021, 22:25 - James: How long before the radical left start promoting gollywogs?
14/04/2021, 22:26 - Paul: Edris in blackface when?
14/04/2021, 22:27 - Mike: It's only fair Paul, every Bond movie opens with James having a banging fry up in a local cafe
14/04/2021, 22:39 - Noone: he doesn't commit violent crimes, he's not black enough
14/04/2021, 22:40 - Noone: shut the fuck up

14/04/2021, 23:17 - Wezz: I love how you're always promoting my ex-employer. Do you want me to send you my old Zavvi shirt/lanyard?
14/04/2021, 23:17 - Derren: I DUNNO WHO YOUR EX EMPLOYEE IS
14/04/2021, 23:18 - Wezz: Here you go mate, I even made a video about it back in 2008:

14/04/2021, 23:22 - Wezz: It's shit don't watch it, saved you 1minute30.
14/04/2021, 23:25 - Wezz: PS George Floydstein didn't kill himself
14/04/2021, 23:30 - Derren: Was very touching
14/04/2021, 23:30 - Derren: Is that you singing
14/04/2021, 23:32 - Wezz: That's Mike Skinner, from The Streets
14/04/2021, 23:36 - Derren: I know who he is, haven't heard that song though, very cute video

This jokester - pours a Corona(?) *out of a bottle and into a glass* and dramatically oversells it. Not even a draught beer. CAN DO THAT AT HOME MATE
15/04/2021, 08:50 - Wezz: Can't even get his lines right
15/04/2021, 08:58 - Mike: Bet he paid 6 quid for it too
15/04/2021, 08:59 - Wezz: IKR, at least give him another take. Sheesh

Very good guide for the league players in chat

15/04/2021, 17:17 - Dayle: Its really good

Really enjoying watching traffic stop videos this evening
15/04/2021, 18:31 - Kirky: "are you pulling me over?" "oh yea i am" "NO WAIT"
15/04/2021, 18:33 - Wezz: Whole thing gave me a massive justice boner
15/04/2021, 18:34 - Lockers: You got a boner and a woman was involved? No wonder she feels unsafe man
15/04/2021, 18:35 - Kirky: sdhould arrrest her for threatening a police officer with pepper spray
15/04/2021, 18:35 - Dayle: <Media omitted>
15/04/2021, 18:43 - Wezz: I mean; she was _not_ involved. Insta injustice boner kil.
15/04/2021, 18:43 - Wezz: Creeps me out
15/04/2021, 18:43 - Wezz: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5lKnO2JbP4

This one gave me mixed emotions... quite like the lady. But bitch gotta GO DOWN
15/04/2021, 18:46 - Nathan: Yesssss taze that bitch
15/04/2021, 18:51 - Mike: The recent army guy one was funny

"Officers I'm scared"

Officer: "oh you should be"
15/04/2021, 18:56 - Derren: Saw this one a few days ago üòÇ
15/04/2021, 19:13 - Wezz: Was this is lieutenant one? - just watched that now. The whole thing was just retardedly frustrating and provoking (surprise surprise, picked up by ALL the news outlets).
Zero justice boners, guy getting arrested was a retard esp at the start, just mumbling and ignoring instruction without reason. Then when the pepper spray hits i feel sorry for him but SHOULD HAVE JUST COOPERATED A LITTLE BUDDY.
15/04/2021, 19:16 - Wezz: Made him seem so suspicious. Link for those interested:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBvn5kRPVC8

Guess he was testing the police or something, his lackadaisical response (prob cause military bg) could be confused with someone concealing something. Meant the whole thing escalated.
15/04/2021, 19:16 - Wezz: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlS8ht3PERs

This link much better - actually cop is a retard LOL.
15/04/2021, 19:18 - Wezz: Once you're sprayed though, you fucking leave your car man. And you got them on cam, report them and make LOADSA money
15/04/2021, 19:24 - Paul: You're mental
15/04/2021, 19:25 - Wezz: Yeah, cop was awful. Other video shows it all. First vid cut some bits out which is nuts.
15/04/2021, 19:26 - Mike: Was my expert quotations not enough?
15/04/2021, 19:28 - Mike: Jack had a similar reaction except he's still firmly on cops side afaik
15/04/2021, 19:29 - Wezz: Yeah didn't hear it in the first vid. He's just a power-hungry idiot and escalated throughout. Do think people have to consider that police don't deal with NORMAL people all day. Unfortunately, they deal with nutcases more often than anyone in society does. That leads to some pretty escalatory behaviour in the event where people don't comply (in US).
15/04/2021, 19:30 - Wezz: For the safety of the officers. However, this shit has #BLM plastered all over it on Youtube. Understandably. Regardless of this guys skin colour, a vid surfacing = firing of the policeman (done) and ¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£.
15/04/2021, 19:30 - Wezz: Rightfully sor
15/04/2021, 19:30 - Wezz: so*

16/04/2021, 10:57 - Mike: Maybe someone is sending a lot of messages to you?
16/04/2021, 10:58 - James: I wish I was that popular, they said they'd had it reported by loads of people

16/04/2021, 11:06 - Derren: good way to boost stats for the amount of chats they do if it crashes people out after 2 mins
16/04/2021, 11:15 - James: Nothing running in Network, I think it's just a poorly implemented live chat
16/04/2021, 11:15 - Derren: try another browser!
16/04/2021, 11:18 - James: I can't I'm conversation with someone and it seem the connection is stored in Chrome cookies or something, logging in on another browser doesn't connect me with the same person
16/04/2021, 11:33 - Wezz: If you actually care and can't see under network/cache. You can do heap snapshots in Chrome. Will show what's using 9gb
16/04/2021, 11:34 - James: It crashed again and killed the conversation, doesn't seem to be happening in Firefox
16/04/2021, 11:34 - Wezz: Was doing it recently as some of my MMA streaming sites started using tonnes of resources. Turns out was a crypto miner set to use x% of cpu

17/04/2021, 22:34 - Wezz: I found out last weekend that the Imperial War Museum (near me) used to be Bethlem Royal Hospital (Bedlam). An insane asylum that coined the term "Bedlam".
17/04/2021, 22:34 - Mike: not a single wombo combo
17/04/2021, 22:35 - Mike: My gaming moniker used to be Bedlam, mostly because my dad would come home and rage about the house being "bedlam"
17/04/2021, 22:35 - Mike: interesting the hear the origination of irt

18/04/2021, 09:18 - Mike: Music fans in Liverpool are to get the chance to enjoy a near-normal gig as part of a government pilot event.

The 5,000-strong crowd at Sefton Park on 2 May will not need to be socially distanced or wear face coverings.

But they will have to provide proof of a negative Covid test to gain entry.
18/04/2021, 09:56 - Paul: Weeb

18/04/2021, 10:11 - Derren: Are you being an ultra nerd and painting figurines as you watch anime
18/04/2021, 10:12 - Paul: He's gotta find some time between sharpening his samurai sword

18/04/2021, 11:01 - Paul: I've never received a bent document before. It's like they saw the message and deliberately bent it

18/04/2021, 14:32 - Wezz: couple hours, prob less

18/04/2021, 16:07 - Noone: I'm back to grey old london town. I went from rolling fields to being mugged by people I can't understand
18/04/2021, 19:31 - Dayle: https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/msjjzx/here_is_senna_with_5000_stacks/?ref_source=embed&ref=share
18/04/2021, 19:41 - Kirky: Take hours and hours to reach that üò≠
18/04/2021, 19:41 - Kirky: My record is like 150 or someshit
18/04/2021, 21:01 - Paul: What do you do in gta online? Why is it so popular on twitch
18/04/2021, 21:07 - Wezz: It's Roleplay (NoPixel server)
18/04/2021, 21:07 - Wezz: Actually pretty good, sent a link a while ago. Loads of different RP scenarios, business owners, cops, legal, crims, tonnes of other stuff
18/04/2021, 21:07 - Wezz: Buddha a pretty good intro streamer
18/04/2021, 21:08 - Paul: So it's kinda like old school garrys mod stuff?
18/04/2021, 21:08 - Nathan: Emily watches it everyday!
18/04/2021, 21:08 - Wezz: Yeah, a lot like Garrys Mod RP server. But better, NoPixel is the most premium RP server, people pay to join it etc. Take it super serious. Plus has extra custom mods on top
18/04/2021, 21:10 - Wezz: So for experienced RPers. Lots of licenses behind things, e.g. owning a house, flying license, fishing, hunting. So soft blocks areas of the game as you progress. They introduce new drugs/mechanics every now and then.
18/04/2021, 21:11 - Paul: And do the streamers like roleplay on their stream or what? What's the appeal of it on twitch
18/04/2021, 21:11 - Wezz: Most recent thing is the addition of a Vault to rob (previously was a only bank robs), has mini games for the crims to complete along the way. And for RP they usually take a hostage and negotiate with the cops. Then after they'll chase/need to lose the cops.
18/04/2021, 21:12 - Wezz: each streamer has at least one character. they RP and talk to fans out of character (OOC)
18/04/2021, 21:12 - Wezz: All the streamers end up linking in with each other
18/04/2021, 21:12 - Paul: But the cops are other RPers in that scenario right
18/04/2021, 21:12 - Wezz: Quite cool cause you see plans come together, people stream hop a lot
18/04/2021, 21:12 - Wezz: yeah exactly. different ranks of cops etc. some corruption going on
18/04/2021, 21:13 - Wezz: but streamers only use info within the game RP obv, no meta
18/04/2021, 21:13 - Paul: It sounds more fun to play than watch. Is it something we could all do together one night?
18/04/2021, 21:13 - Wezz: The free servers are absolutely garbage
18/04/2021, 21:13 - Wezz: Prob better going into Gmod loool
18/04/2021, 21:13 - Paul: Ah ok
18/04/2021, 21:14 - Kirky: JAILBREAK ?
18/04/2021, 21:14 - Paul: Didn't Jack Noone used to masturbate to jailbreak
18/04/2021, 21:15 - Wezz: Yeah it's really cool man. If you watch the regulars there's some seriously good story telling. Big arcs over multiple streams and multiple weeks
18/04/2021, 21:15 - Paul: So is it like a constantly evolving thing or do they do like episodes where they all come on together?
18/04/2021, 21:16 - Wezz: Constantly evolving. A lot is adlibbed. Admin open new stores and content which kinda directs things
18/04/2021, 21:17 - Paul: Think I'd have to check it out to really get it
18/04/2021, 21:21 - Wezz: E.g. one cop got insider info and knew crims were gonna car swap to lose the cop in a chase after a bank rob. so that cop decided to get in the boot of the car before the car swap so they could track them on phone GPS. Cue this clip:
18/04/2021, 21:21 - Wezz: https://www.reddit.com/r/RPClipsGTA/comments/mfgww9/pop_your_trunk/
18/04/2021, 21:23 - Paul: Lmao
18/04/2021, 21:23 - Wezz: Yeah if you watch any stream you see people you like and just tune in. Everyone's a bit diff
18/04/2021, 22:35 - Derren: @447835575116 careful playing normal gta servers they get hosted on somebody's pc and they can get your ip and rockstar tag as well as other info, it's a shambles
18/04/2021, 22:41 - Paul: Cheers for the tip
19/04/2021, 08:14 - Noone: Jailbreak was great
19/04/2021, 09:19 - Mike: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-56777436?fbclid=IwAR2JVx4XLXaq020LC5FuiIUJHUnMc4MN5M8W3lFTH_b__0uuqciWC35PYwk

19/04/2021, 11:49 - Mike: Down to .75~at 10% deposit though, but yeh the interest is big
19/04/2021, 11:51 - Derren: Where did you read that
19/04/2021, 11:52 - Mike: However,analysts say rates could be cut significantly, by as much as 0.75 of a percentage point, for borrowers able to stretch to a 10% deposit.
19/04/2021, 11:52 - Mike: Wait is that cut by, as in down to 3.25%?
19/04/2021, 11:53 - Derren: Yes
19/04/2021, 11:53 - Mike: My mistake
19/04/2021, 11:53 - Derren: Cut by not cut to
19/04/2021, 11:53 - Mike: Was thinking that'd be dope

19/04/2021, 12:06 - Mike: That is how bubbles do, keep tweeting Elon for backup
19/04/2021, 12:08 - Dayle: 4/20 tomorrow doge smoking a blunt as kirky has mentioned might make an appearance and then we are gonna buy boats
19/04/2021, 12:11 - Wezz: Imagine investing in something where you expect price to increase with 4/20 date.

We're living in a strange timeline.
19/04/2021, 12:11 - Wezz: Investors hate him
19/04/2021, 12:11 - Kirky: All it takes is one Elon 4 20 doge tweet
19/04/2021, 12:13 - Wezz: 100% true. Hope papa Elon pays you both out

19/04/2021, 12:45 - Dayle: kraken / coin base / trust wallet
19/04/2021, 12:46 - Derren: They have fees?
19/04/2021, 12:47 - Dayle: kraken does for withdrawing
19/04/2021, 12:47 - Dayle: trust wallet is just a crypto holding wallet
19/04/2021, 12:47 - Dayle: coin base is abit more shit
19/04/2021, 12:49 - Derren: You tried freetrade or trading212?

19/04/2021, 15:51 - Kirky: Sorry misto
19/04/2021, 15:54 - Derren: üò™
19/04/2021, 15:59 - Paul: Damn kirky gimme that diabetes
19/04/2021, 16:00 - Paul: Unless this is about to get a spread of butter and put on the grill then I agree it's sad
19/04/2021, 16:00 - Kirky: They make that on the chef show on Netflix lol. Not sure what episode. With the American bakery lady
19/04/2021, 16:01 - Derren: I'm not a fan of toasting bread for a sandwich like that, only if it's pure cheese
19/04/2021, 16:02 - Paul: So just room temp bread with cooked insides?
19/04/2021, 16:03 - James: Yeah man, nothing beats some decent soft bread for an egg and bacon sandwich
19/04/2021, 16:03 - Qck: Let it not be the softness of bread that divides us once and for all
19/04/2021, 16:03 - Wezz: Too much shit in that sandwich for my liking. Should just make it a full English, mix and match as you please
19/04/2021, 16:04 - Paul: Wezz that's straight out of left field. Are we gonna debate burgers with knives and forks again
19/04/2021, 16:04 - Wezz: It's just a bit too complicated for me.. give me a bacon sandwich or a cheese toasty any day. I'm a simple man
19/04/2021, 16:05 - Wezz: Lot going on there, gives me anxiety
19/04/2021, 16:05 - James: I'm with you on this one, the cheese is out of nowhere. I love cheese, but give it it's own sandwich, and let the egg and bacon be with some brown sauce
19/04/2021, 16:05 - Paul: If it's not dripping down my shirt it's not food
19/04/2021, 16:05 - Kirky: Agreed. I want that egg to squirt out down my chin on the first bite
19/04/2021, 16:06 - Wezz: Dude, post your burger here again
19/04/2021, 16:06 - Wezz: That should invalidate your comments
19/04/2021, 16:06 - Paul: Maybe he'll get the LOTR cherry tomato explosion at least
19/04/2021, 16:06 - Qck: If you love cheese you do not love that pre shredded whey dust he's eating
19/04/2021, 16:07 - Wezz: James know.

Only a psychopath puts that much stuff between two pieces of bread. Lose all structural integrity.
19/04/2021, 16:07 - Paul: Made my first ever cheese toastie the other day btw. Was pretty cool
19/04/2021, 16:07 - Wezz: Aren't you the cheese hating weirdo I know?
19/04/2021, 16:07 - Paul: THAT'S WHY YOU TOAST IT FFS
19/04/2021, 16:08 - Paul: I'm new to the cheese game yeah. Still a rookie but I like it now
19/04/2021, 16:08 - Qck: <Media omitted>
19/04/2021, 16:09 - James: Fuck I love salmon. 10/10 bagel, well done.
19/04/2021, 16:09 - Wezz: Cream cheese and salmon? Poppy seed bagel? Looks good to me
19/04/2021, 16:09 - Paul: That's a vagina
19/04/2021, 16:09 - Wezz: Is it _tomato_ in there?
19/04/2021, 16:09 - James: Oh good question, I hope not
19/04/2021, 16:09 - Wezz: And capers?
19/04/2021, 16:10 - Wezz: Also it's store bought so you can fuck off tbh
19/04/2021, 16:10 - Paul: Yeah for sure bakery job
19/04/2021, 16:10 - Paul: Doesn't count
19/04/2021, 16:10 - James: Isn't that the thing with the three mini coopers?
19/04/2021, 16:10 - Qck: Man I should upload more photos of my lunch, I see why Dayle does it now
19/04/2021, 16:11 - Mike: Try some Worcester sauce on the cheese toastie, love the sharp tang amongst it
19/04/2021, 16:11 - Derren: fucking shop bought food
19/04/2021, 16:12 - Wezz: No, that's the Italian Job. Wasn't it the incredibly hard job/mission?
19/04/2021, 16:13 - Qck: Don't be mad just because your diabetes waffle sold out so you ended up with a sadwich
19/04/2021, 16:14 - Paul: I dipped it into mango chutney at the advice of Jamie Oliver
19/04/2021, 16:14 - Qck: Bro if I was you I'd be making Turkish eggs everyday knowing that my inherent birthright makes it taste so much better
19/04/2021, 16:14 - Kirky: Shakshuka?
19/04/2021, 16:14 - James: I'm a big fan of toasties with spicy mayo
19/04/2021, 16:15 - Paul: Oh so many new options!
19/04/2021, 16:15 - Qck: Nah Cilbir, similar though
19/04/2021, 16:15 - Paul: Were you*
19/04/2021, 16:15 - Kirky: Had a shakshuka at that cafe near Mike's. Fuxking excellent
19/04/2021, 16:15 - Qck: I'm talking to Derren in his language
19/04/2021, 16:15 - Paul: ü•≤
19/04/2021, 16:15 - Wezz: You've literally _only just entered_ the cheese world. You have so much to do.
19/04/2021, 16:16 - Qck: Your girlfriends pussy looks like a salmon bagel?
19/04/2021, 16:16 - Paul: I know man it's great.
19/04/2021, 16:16 - James: and it smells like one too
19/04/2021, 16:16 - Paul: Jesus
19/04/2021, 16:16 - Paul: 50 points from house Phillips for that one
19/04/2021, 16:17 - James: That single word reaction nearly made me spit tea all over my keyboard
19/04/2021, 16:17 - Kirky: Tried halloumi yet ?
19/04/2021, 16:17 - Wezz: Got a significant snigger out of me
19/04/2021, 16:17 - Wezz: SNIGGER
19/04/2021, 16:18 - Paul: Yeah we made halloumi carrot and zucchini fried cakes
19/04/2021, 16:18 - Wezz: I never believed you when you said you didn't like cheese. Just thought you were a spoiled child being difficult.
19/04/2021, 16:18 - Paul: I feel like this word shouldn't be ok
19/04/2021, 16:19 - Kirky: Oh yea ofc. Just straight fried halloumi is amazing
19/04/2021, 16:19 - Mike: Tried to have it as my username on club penguin and it wasn't then
19/04/2021, 16:19 - Paul: It was 100% psychological as I think most food dislikes can turn out to be
19/04/2021, 16:20 - Paul: I blame my junior school for serving us cold food and refusing to let us leave until it was finished. It was fucking child abuse
19/04/2021, 16:20 - Derren: Can't eat shakshuka everyday
19/04/2021, 16:20 - Qck: This guys drank the koolaid of his degree and is trying to psychoanalyse cheese now
19/04/2021, 16:21 - Paul: What does your favourite cheese say about you? Top 10 cheese types analysed. (Number 6 will shock you)!
19/04/2021, 16:21 - Wezz: If I were your Mum, I'd have stuck cheese up your bum.
19/04/2021, 16:22 - Derren: Edam ‚ù§Ô∏è
19/04/2021, 16:22 - Paul: Freud would have a field day with this kid
19/04/2021, 16:23 - Kirky: maybe she did
19/04/2021, 16:23 - Kirky: maybe thats the problem
19/04/2021, 16:23 - Paul: Isn't that how you guys eat? South park style
19/04/2021, 17:03 - Dayle: just gonna say who has been listening to the feel good british summer time playlist haha :D

19/04/2021, 19:50 - Noone: @447835575116 you are working towards a doctorate in bullshit; what do you make of all this?
19/04/2021, 21:19 - Paul: Yes
19/04/2021, 21:38 - Wezz: Loooool, I like to think it was 99 minutes of crying and then a "Yes".
19/04/2021, 21:38 - Lockers: Good maffs
19/04/2021, 21:38 - Wezz: 89 :(

20/04/2021, 09:28 - James: "I broke the thing and now it's not working"
20/04/2021, 09:28 - Dayle: no RFC?
20/04/2021, 09:29 - James: You're assuming this is someone who cares about how things work and the processes around them
20/04/2021, 09:30 - Mike: Sorry m8 I don't speak nerd
20/04/2021, 09:31 - Mike: I emailed them saying simplest solution will be renaming the folder back, "thank you you can close the ticket"
20/04/2021, 09:31 - Paul: I'm curious what the more difficult solution is
20/04/2021, 09:32 - James: Mike changing the code so that it compensates for user error
20/04/2021, 09:32 - Paul: Thanks James I had no idea
20/04/2021, 09:32 - James: Classic Paul having no idea
20/04/2021, 09:33 - Paul: How's the pudding
20/04/2021, 09:33 - James: Pretty terracotta, thank you, hows the eggs and legs?
20/04/2021, 09:33 - Paul: Stfu
20/04/2021, 09:34 - James: That's what I thought
20/04/2021, 09:35 - Dayle: Request for Comments
RFC is also an abbreviation for Remote Function Call . A Request for Comments (RFC) is a formal document from the Internet Engineering Task Force ( IETF ) that is the result of committee drafting and subsequent review by interested parties.

So no cunt makes these stupid changes
20/04/2021, 09:35 - Mike: Mike installing a guard dog that barks when users do anything other than create new files
20/04/2021, 09:36 - Mike: Fuck that cumbersome shit, Visa had it and it slowed everything down so much
20/04/2021, 09:36 - Dayle: yeah i fucking hate it with all my soul
20/04/2021, 09:37 - Dayle: but it enables retards to be less retards
20/04/2021, 09:37 - James: We had it as request for change, but similar thing to make sure nobody runs something that drops the database by accident
20/04/2021, 09:39 - Derren: <Media omitted>
20/04/2021, 09:39 - Paul: Didn't work for you though??
20/04/2021, 09:40 - Mike: Nice music tho
20/04/2021, 09:41 - Dayle: your still in school being held back right, rich talk
20/04/2021, 09:41 - Paul: You're
20/04/2021, 09:41 - Dayle: fuck you in
20/04/2021, 09:41 - Dayle: win*
20/04/2021, 09:41 - Paul: üòÇ
20/04/2021, 09:49 - Dayle: yeah its for enterprise or sizing companies - if you was a start up or a medium size company this shit is trash as normally you have like 1 or 2 engineers actually making changes - it honestly is the worst part of my job being held back to implement changes quickly but fuck it, if your feeling alittle lazy you can be like waiting on this to be put through cab lol.
20/04/2021, 09:59 - Derren: https://youtu.be/FmaTX53-nUM Similar to forest temple :D also this is master quest which I haven't completed so I'm not looking forward to it
20/04/2021, 10:22 - Noone: Literal bombshell
20/04/2021, 11:18 - Mike: Can anyone eli5 the ESL controversy? I thought football fans would want more football matches or whatever
20/04/2021, 11:19 - James: Football is for nerds, and people are angry that it's still being played
20/04/2021, 11:19 - Kirky: Well everyones mad cause they saw ESL and thought all the top players were switching the counter strike
20/04/2021, 11:20 - James: The problem with Fabregas is he always tries to walk the bomb in
20/04/2021, 11:21 - Alex: If you're actually interested it's because the big games are special and happen very rarely, and to get these games you have to be good enough. Here it will be every week with zero real competition as the teams in the esl cant get relegated. Sport is about winning and losing, so remove any consequence from losing and who gives a fuck?
20/04/2021, 11:22 - Alex: On top of that, people love the underdog story, Leicester won the prem from out of nowhere, other small teams beating big teams are known as giant killers. These events would be impossible in the esl
20/04/2021, 11:22 - James: So it's kind of like a bunch of famous team have been told they're too big to fail, so they get to be in the special league forever?
20/04/2021, 11:23 - Alex: Pretty much, when half these teams havent even won the tournament they claim to be too good for. Arsenal and Tottenham are not good enough to qualify for the champions league, but are claiming the quality of football needs to be better in the champions league (a level they arent good enough to play at)
20/04/2021, 11:23 - Alex: Teams in football need to rise and fall, and the esl would stick everything in a stasis as is
20/04/2021, 11:24 - James: I can see why that would upset people, why would they care about being good if they're guaranteed the same amount of games with the same big names every year?
20/04/2021, 11:25 - Alex: Exactly, also remove any consequence from losing and you lose any joy in winning. Liverpool recently lost to real madrid in the champions league, but it was exciting because they havent played each other for a few years. Who fucking cares if they lose if they can just play again in a weeks time
20/04/2021, 11:44 - Piper: Its all greed
20/04/2021, 11:45 - Piper: It could really hurt the domestic leagues
20/04/2021, 11:49 - Paul: Yeah already asked Jack about all this
20/04/2021, 11:50 - Paul: Seems insanely greedy
20/04/2021, 11:50 - Lockers: Pretty much what Alex and piper said. Rich getting richer and not distributing the money across the pyramid and completely removing the competitive integrity of the sport. Its been brewing for years but obvs it could have a massive economic impact in Europe, particularly UK, because of the money it brings in. But with this, it doesn't keep it in the country necessarily as well. Eg Liverpool could play Barca... In China
20/04/2021, 11:51 - Paul: Isn't this why they have tighter regulations on club ownership in bundesliga? To stop people like the glazers
20/04/2021, 11:52 - James: Ahh, it all comes down to the Chinese again
20/04/2021, 11:53 - Dayle: <Media omitted>
20/04/2021, 11:53 - Lockers: Hungry now thanks
20/04/2021, 11:54 - Lockers: Exactly why the 50+1 rule is great. Love the German approach tbh
20/04/2021, 11:54 - Lockers: Excuse me we're talking about football can you stop trying to spread positivity? Thanks
20/04/2021, 11:55 - Paul: üëçüèª
20/04/2021, 11:55 - Paul: I wonder if ESL could actually sue them
20/04/2021, 11:56 - Paul: Kinda like what happened with WWF
20/04/2021, 11:57 - James: When the pandas sued the WWF for using their image without permission?
20/04/2021, 11:58 - Paul: Here comes kung fu panda with the steel chair! Bah gawd!!

20/04/2021, 12:18 - Wezz: Obv COVID cost the football clubs a boat load of money so they're more susceptible to this kinda offer now. 3.5bil euro cost for the league supposedly.

I've heard a lot of bs justification though, like teams cant be promoted/demoted, seems they could from the plans I saw. Also lockers point about China is a bit overblown, supposedly plans were 2leg home and away games up until the final, in which it's single leg on 'neutral soil'. That's 1 match out of >100 or so? But yeah defo would be in Dubai for ¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£.

Lots of issues around lack of meritocracy in deciding initial teams. Impact on UK and Italian national leagues thus economy. Thing I don't understand is what role do FIFA play in this? Are they a regulatory agency? Can they stop players playing elsewhere? If so, would that be a global monopoly?

Disclaimer: I know nothing about football.
20/04/2021, 12:20 - Paul: I think it's more on UEFA to fine, or punish teams than FIFA, but someone can correct me if I'm wrong
20/04/2021, 12:25 - Wezz: The fact that's it's even being discussed with some sincerity makes me think it's feasible.

Also, considering all the negative press; do fans think UEFA/FIFA are *not* money grabbing in the same way?
20/04/2021, 12:28 - Wezz: My football friends (ooo friends) used to complain about the wage discrepancy between prem and championship a lot. And all the oil baron owners spending billions and ruining the game etc.

Found it stark comparison to US sports who utilise draft picks and salary caps etc  etc.

20/04/2021, 12:52 - James: What if you're exactly 30?
20/04/2021, 12:53 - Wezz: We're heartless and homeless buddy!
20/04/2021, 12:53 - Paul: Yeah because the over 30s need to justify their shit lives and accept it

20/04/2021, 13:27 - Mike: @447835575116 take notes Paul, if you want to rile up plebs into a revolution change their football to a Monday instead of thursday

20/04/2021, 21:14 - Wezz: Yeah, I even thought about it when writing. But pretty sure _possessive_ pluralisation is with the *'s* regardless of ending in s.
20/04/2021, 21:15 - Paul: Wouldn't it be Williams'
20/04/2021, 21:15 - Paul: Because it needs an extra S but you don't do that if it already ends in S
20/04/2021, 21:15 - Paul: No idea
20/04/2021, 21:15 - Wezz: It's _her_ vagina. So she owns it. Hence my keeping of the S
20/04/2021, 21:16 - Lockers: Yes
20/04/2021, 21:16 - Paul: Right but it would need to be Williams's
20/04/2021, 21:16 - Lockers: I can never remember it's and its
20/04/2021, 21:17 - Lockers: You used two here m8 üëè

20/04/2021, 21:17 - Wezz: Ah, I fucked his surname. Fair doos
20/04/2021, 21:18 - Wezz: Williams's is correct. Looks fucking awful. But it's correct lol
20/04/2021, 21:18 - Paul: Williams' I thought but what do I know
20/04/2021, 21:19 - Lockers: You're right ffs
20/04/2021, 21:19 - Paul: James your name ends in S you'll know this
20/04/2021, 21:19 - Wezz: If it is POSSESSIVE you add both the apostrophe and s. Regardless of it ending in an S or not.
20/04/2021, 21:19 - Wezz: I can't believe this man teaches our country
20/04/2021, 21:19 - Paul: Ok TIL
20/04/2021, 21:20 - Paul: Well not true I probably learned it in like year 4
20/04/2021, 21:20 - James: I thought it was James'
20/04/2021, 21:20 - James: as the second s is implied
20/04/2021, 21:20 - Wezz: Oh my godf
20/04/2021, 21:21 - James: You're not going to write James'nt
20/04/2021, 21:21 - Lockers: So where would you use "James' "?
20/04/2021, 21:21 - Paul: God I'm so glad it's not just me that's shit at this lmao
20/04/2021, 21:21 - Kirky: This while conversation is blowing my mind

20/04/2021, 21:22 - Lockers: Ffs now my phones woken up
20/04/2021, 21:22 - Wezz: It's the correct rule most of the time; if it ends in S just add the apostrophe. But not with possessives.
20/04/2021, 21:23 - Lockers: Jk android >
20/04/2021, 21:23 - Wezz: If it's his families, a plural
20/04/2021, 21:23 - Wezz: E.g. That's the Williams' house over there.
20/04/2021, 21:23 - Lockers: Terrible example üòÇ
20/04/2021, 21:24 - Lockers: Because that could definitely suggest that it belongs to the Williams family rather than the group of Williams
20/04/2021, 21:24 - Wezz: the prefix THE helps
20/04/2021, 21:24 - Lockers: Yes but it could belong to the group
20/04/2021, 21:25 - Wezz: Fucking bunch of Williams?!/#
20/04/2021, 21:25 - Wezz: First name William, a group of them??
20/04/2021, 21:25 - Paul: Lmao
20/04/2021, 21:25 - Wezz: A group of people called William.
20/04/2021, 21:25 - Wezz: ?
20/04/2021, 21:25 - Wezz: LOL
20/04/2021, 21:25 - Paul: üòÇüòÇüòÇ
20/04/2021, 21:25 - Wezz: Okay, Lockers has got me
20/04/2021, 21:26 - Lockers: Now this definitely isn't the correct use of grammar, get out
20/04/2021, 21:27 - Wezz: Can't wait to purchase a house with all the Sams in this chat. Going to cost be a quid.
20/04/2021, 21:27 - Paul: There's a great bit on QI about this where dara obrien says "trust me no one is rushing into super markets shouting where are all the green grocers!" Due to the lack of apostrophe
20/04/2021, 21:28 - Wezz: BE A QUID fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
20/04/2021, 21:28 - Paul: Now we have blackslashs and pound signs? Fuck my punctuation game needs some work
20/04/2021, 21:29 - Paul: Clearly a forward slash Paul
20/04/2021, 21:29 - Wezz: üòÇ
20/04/2021, 21:37 - Wezz: I might frame this on my wall tbh
20/04/2021, 21:43 - Qck: I thought it was W'lliam#‚Ç¨s if it was plural
20/04/2021, 21:43 - Qck: Thanks guys for clearing it up
20/04/2021, 21:43 - Wezz: You're welcome mate. Your Mum's vagina means a lot to me.
20/04/2021, 21:43 - Lockers: Just asked an English teacher. Both are fine according to her üòÇ "some people insist on the extra s"
20/04/2021, 21:44 - Qck: Okay now can you ask someone who's qualified to speak on the subject
20/04/2021, 21:44 - Lockers: Ok I'll ask an English teacher
20/04/2021, 21:44 - Qck: An English teacher of children
20/04/2021, 21:45 - Paul: To be fair I teach adults and I'm a retard
20/04/2021, 21:45 - Lockers: I mean, nobody is going to argue that
20/04/2021, 21:45 - Wezz: BOTH ARE _FINE_?
20/04/2021, 21:46 - Lockers: Sorry, mighty fine
20/04/2021, 21:46 - Wezz: She spent all that money on a degree to tell us that _both are fine_?
20/04/2021, 21:46 - Qck: "teach" "adults"

Jerking off at the park isn't teaching young adults sex ed
20/04/2021, 21:46 - Wezz: Did you give her your example about the group of people called William?
20/04/2021, 21:47 - Paul: What the fuck would you call it then dumbass
20/04/2021, 21:50 - Wezz: Well, *Grammarly* does say that both ways are correct. But that's some modern-day bullshit (source: https://www.grammarly.com/blog/possessive-case/)

If she wants to up her game, she can go *Merriam-Webster* (https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/what-happens-to-names-when-we-make-them-plural-or-possessive) or *Cambridge* (https://dictionary.cambridge.org/grammar/british-grammar/possession-john-s-car-a-friend-of-mine)
20/04/2021, 21:54 - Paul: Language evolves grandpa
20/04/2021, 21:58 - Wezz: The sad thing is, I really like Grammarly üòî

Can't find another source that agrees with them though, except two school teachers and an Ausl√§nder.

20/04/2021, 22:36 - Derren: What you up to mate
20/04/2021, 22:47 - Paul: Hmm well we're talking about a very vocal tiny minority of people here. I don't think that the narrative that this is somehow unique to Germany is a fair characterisation. We've seen the mobilisation of far right attitudes explode globally over the past decade or so. In many ways I'd say Germany has been extremely progressive recently with a lot of its political decisions which will always cause backlash and ignite the extremists to show themselves.
20/04/2021, 22:49 - Qck: Is this a Dayle copypasta
20/04/2021, 22:49 - Paul: It's true that the AfD have had a lot of growth which is concerning though
20/04/2021, 22:52 - Paul: Hmm well we're talking about a very tiny penis here. I don't think that the narrative that this is somehow unique to toms cock is a fair characterisation. We've seen the mobilisation of Hippocratic oaths explode globally over the past week or so. In many ways id say Lockers has been extremely batty recently with a lot of his teaching decisions  which will always cause backlash and ignite the extremists to show themselves

21/04/2021, 14:33 - Paul: I'm assuming with a more finely integrated sauce you'd go spoon then
21/04/2021, 14:37 - James: Fork, rice and naan is for soaking the sauce up
21/04/2021, 14:40 - Wezz: If it's too finely integrated I'd use a straw
21/04/2021, 14:44 - Kirky: Yea, but also depends what else is with it. Onion khakis etc? Fork fosho

21/04/2021, 16:19 - Qck: Glad I'm not the only one who fantasises about that
21/04/2021, 16:19 - James: Sam's got a hold-able dick, it's not like we've not seen it
21/04/2021, 16:27 - Qck: You hear that Paul?! Has Julia even given evidence that you *have* a penis? I mean I've never seen it...
21/04/2021, 16:28 - James: I've never seen it...
21/04/2021, 16:28 - Lockers: Me neither!!!!
21/04/2021, 16:29 - Paul: That was never mentioned as a requirement during my corona gaming team interview
21/04/2021, 16:29 - Paul: Wait a minute... Now that I think about it... me neither
21/04/2021, 16:31 - Paul: Wait no you guys have seen it. Jack Noone posted it in here ages ago at Christmas
21/04/2021, 16:31 - Paul: Dunno how he got that pic
21/04/2021, 16:32 - Wezz: Ah I remember, the giant black veiny one. Bit on the small side tbh
21/04/2021, 16:35 - James: Yeah, kind of embarrassing that you'd even remind us of that, I'd have gone with not having a penis at that point
21/04/2021, 16:35 - Paul: Yeah well my e-peen is huge
21/04/2021, 16:46 - James: The groups silence speak volumes

21/04/2021, 21:03 - Wezz: I just read this exchange regarding the League devs:

"They're just a bunch of bros farting in each other's faces, not enough oxygen gets to their brain for them to think."

I thought, that's interesting, probably one of those Paul-isms pooing out my ears etc etc.

And then someone links this article in which their COO actually got suspended for farting in colleagues faces?:

21/04/2021, 21:05 - Wezz: For anyone wondering; he's still the COO.

21/04/2021, 21:16 - Wezz: OI MATE, GREAT CLIENT YOU GOT THERE CHEEKY FART ON YOUR LIPS WELL DONE 'NOTHER SKIN NOW
21/04/2021, 21:20 - Mike: Someone mentioned having a date on the weekend at Visa, we had an anonymous complaint about lad culture in the office lol
21/04/2021, 21:26 - Wezz: How pathetic. Look on the bright side:

21/04/2021, 22:13 - Lockers: Minutes
21/04/2021, 22:29 - Dayle: <Media omitted>
21/04/2021, 22:29 - Dayle: I swim twice a day 30 mins each try and keep in-between 1500 or 2000 cals and do weights at home
21/04/2021, 22:30 - Lockers: I don't swim so what kinda pace is that? Like intensity?
21/04/2021, 22:34 - Dayle: <Media omitted>
21/04/2021, 22:36 - Lockers: Ok but I mean for you, out of 20 how intense is that?
21/04/2021, 22:36 - Dayle: 7/20
21/04/2021, 22:37 - Mike: fucking slacker, get back in the pool
21/04/2021, 22:38 - Wezz: Best SWOLF = 22? *scoffs*
21/04/2021, 22:38 - Lockers: A lot of room then! Up those numbers and the calories will be significantly improved. 7 is very, very light
21/04/2021, 22:39 - Mike: "SWOLF is the combination of your stroke count and time taken in the water and is often used as a measure of your swimming efficiency." TIL
21/04/2021, 22:40 - Wezz: Yeah, I genuinely had no idea what a SWOLF was. Thanks
21/04/2021, 22:42 - Wezz: More info: you take the amount of seconds PLUS the number of strokes per 25m. That's your SWOLF.

E.g. takes 30 seconds and 10 strokes to do 25m. Your score is 40
21/04/2021, 22:43 - Dayle: I actually never knew that
21/04/2021, 22:43 - Paul: Keeping up that pace would be tough for a beginner
21/04/2021, 22:43 - Dayle: give me a week ill up my swolf
21/04/2021, 22:43 - Wezz: So that 22 SWOLF score is pretty mad. Probably a big push off?
21/04/2021, 22:43 - Wezz: Try measuring your SWOLF after you've done some mad wall push using your legs and no strokes
21/04/2021, 22:44 - Dayle: no its a very light swim tbh
21/04/2021, 22:45 - Wezz: I think we can get your SWOLF down to single digits if you streamline your body like a dolphin, push off with the strength of an Ox, and torpedo your way 25m
21/04/2021, 22:45 - Paul: So my best 50m speed was something like 31s  so I don't believe that 22 SWOLF lol
21/04/2021, 22:46 - Paul: Ubless it was as wezz said just you under water with no strokes
21/04/2021, 22:47 - Wezz: Yeah I assume since push off = no strokes. That's a good way to keep swolf low.. I also have no idea what I'm talking about
21/04/2021, 22:48 - Dayle: <Media omitted>
21/04/2021, 22:48 - Dayle: This is another swim the other day
21/04/2021, 22:49 - Paul: Weird do you do one mega quick length at some point?
21/04/2021, 22:50 - Dayle: must be a bug
21/04/2021, 22:50 - Dayle: im not a 22 swolfer
21/04/2021, 22:50 - Paul: Nah bugs are shit swimmers except those ones that glide on the surface and is that really swimming??
21/04/2021, 22:52 - Wezz: We had a bug tryna pull that shit in our Bannatyne's. Swift uppercut to the antenna
21/04/2021, 22:52 - Lockers: Push him along obvs
21/04/2021, 22:52 - Lockers: Or pull ü§î

21/04/2021, 23:18 - Paul: So what's the answer? What number = love?
21/04/2021, 23:19 - Alex: It was somewhere just above 30, but below 42 ironically enough
21/04/2021, 23:19 - Wezz: So you're saying there's hope..
21/04/2021, 23:20 - Alex: Oh god no, the coefficient falls to 0 when in conjunction with pandemic themed gaming chats

23/04/2021, 09:35 - Wezz: Would it help if I said I'm actually indifferent about LotR. I watched the first movie, then had my first kiss during the second one and never looked back.

23/04/2021, 09:36 - Wezz: Also I more recently watched Hobbit in the cinema and it was God awful and reminded me of LotR. So that just made things worse

23/04/2021, 10:32 - Paul: Who was your first kiss?
23/04/2021, 10:33 - Paul: Most of us tolerate the hobbit purely for the fact that it's more time we can spend in middle earth but it just isn't in any comparable to the original trilogy which is just an absolute masterpiece

23/04/2021, 14:43 - Wezz: Well, that's the usual fear-mongering from the top, but certainly a fragile time for it.

23/04/2021, 15:36 - Qck: Self thread with a trash body of text?
23/04/2021, 15:36 - Paul: A single comment isn't a thread bro that doesn't make sense
23/04/2021, 15:37 - Qck: Okay, your thread is titled "anyone else wondering if we are gonna wear masks after corona?"
23/04/2021, 15:37 - Wezz: Bloody Germans are so pedantic
23/04/2021, 15:38 - Qck: And your shit body of text remains
23/04/2021, 15:38 - Qck: Are you happy
23/04/2021, 15:38 - Paul: Much better
23/04/2021, 15:39 - Wezz: Just looking to start a war wherever they go
23/04/2021, 15:39 - Paul: Askreddit doesn't allow OP text bodies anymore though so that doesn't work either
23/04/2021, 15:40 - Qck: Glad I get to plead ignorance when it comes to the format of an askreddit thread
23/04/2021, 15:41 - Paul: Mens fashion advice and hip hop heads is enough right
23/04/2021, 15:41 - Noone: You virgins can't just have a discussion, you have to fantasise about "this would be a great question for Reddit!"
23/04/2021, 15:42 - Noone: "hey nice question Paul, you should ask Reddit, you'd get heckin loads of updoots! Maybe even a silver, hey! (Edit): thanks for the silver kind sir!"
23/04/2021, 15:42 - Paul: >be me
>implying implications
23/04/2021, 15:42 - Noone: Also if anyone knows a woman please tell me, I've not had sex in so long
23/04/2021, 15:43 - Paul: There's a protection joke in here somewhere
23/04/2021, 15:45 - Noone: T minus 1hr 15 mins until Dayle goes FAST
23/04/2021, 15:46 - Noone: @447429507368 you got a game plan for this wheeler dealer? Gunna bring him down?
23/04/2021, 15:46 - Qck: Mens fashion advice
23/04/2021, 15:47 - Qck: You've bought a couple of cars Jack, what was your tactic when it came to haggling the price down?
23/04/2021, 15:48 - Noone: Well, I didn't haggle on the last car I bought but that was a little different from a main dealer.
I'd say if it's a regular used car place, use auto trader to find the private sale value, add on 25% for their margin and see if that price Is less than what they're asking for. If it is, you could probably take it for that if you don't budge and give into their bullshit.
23/04/2021, 15:49 - Noone: Be prepared to walk out the door. Since it's a BMW, there's fuck loads of them out there. It's not a rare spec either so that works well for you. Just tell them you need something for work and you're not too fussed as a car guy, you just want something reliable and good on the motorway
23/04/2021, 15:50 - Noone: If it's not got a FSH or needs a service coming up you can use that too. Don't take any of their bs extras like gap insurance. If they offer a *factory* warranty then I'd say take it
23/04/2021, 15:51 - Noone: Before you start it up check the oil filler cap underside. If it's milky then it's a no no
23/04/2021, 15:52 - Noone: But it's a young car so I doubt there will be anything mechanically wrong with it
23/04/2021, 15:52 - Wezz: Some solid advice üëå
23/04/2021, 15:52 - Nathan: Depends on the car. I took it on my audi and got like 6000 off the gap insurance
23/04/2021, 15:53 - Noone: Also, any aftermarket mods will bring the price down significantly from what I've seen, so if there's anything bolted onto it mention that
23/04/2021, 15:53 - Noone: If the depreciation at the time of the crash is high then you'll get fucked, but I doubt dayles car will depreciate that heavily
23/04/2021, 15:54 - Noone: By the looks of it it's already taken the biggest depreciation hit it'll take for a few more years, which is a perfect time to buy from dayles perspective
23/04/2021, 15:55 - Nathan: Not if you take RTI gap insurance which is there return to invoice, so what ever your invoice value is (this includes those optional extras that you put into it) they will pay out to that value and gap will cover the difference that your insurance will pay
23/04/2021, 15:55 - Nathan: Agreed though for this particular car yes
23/04/2021, 15:56 - Noone: All the guys who I work with who own mega fast cars all have gap insurance, I was going to get it before I realised how much my regular insurance already was :))))))))
23/04/2021, 15:57 - Nathan: Yeah can be worth it for certain cars or brand new cars even
23/04/2021, 16:00 - Noone: But yeah, because it's a sensible (but fast) car you could easilly be believed for just wanting it for work. If they get the impression you want it because it'll be a fun car they won't negotiate as well with you
23/04/2021, 16:07 - Kirky: Does gap insurance help you save face if you get gapped in a fast car ?
23/04/2021, 16:07 - Kirky: By a civic
23/04/2021, 16:12 - Derren: @447835575116 You can be like asians and wear a mask if you're sick out of respect for others
23/04/2021, 16:13 - Derren: I haven't had any colds this year either but I also haven't seen anybody and I think it would be weird to have a mask on 24/7 in an office if everything is "normal"
23/04/2021, 16:17 - Mike: Derren knows
23/04/2021, 16:17 - Derren: Well I will most likely do that going forward
23/04/2021, 16:17 - Wezz: Can I be good at video games like Asians too?
23/04/2021, 16:18 - Derren: No
23/04/2021, 16:18 - Derren: But you can have a tiny penis like they do
23/04/2021, 16:23 - Noone: Fucking lold
23/04/2021, 16:23 - Noone: Please don't give mike any more reasons to pursue his highly destructive Asian fetish

25/04/2021, 20:52 - Dayle: Some people just want to watch the world burn he should be charged with attempted manslaughter for 22 counts
25/04/2021, 20:52 - Paul: Isn't manslaughter accidental
25/04/2021, 20:53 - Lockers: Yeah and did anyone die?
25/04/2021, 20:53 - James: Manslaughter is without premeditation
25/04/2021, 20:53 - Dayle: Its accidental death right so him being a knob not knowing people would die and then being sorry for it after is like that I suppose
25/04/2021, 20:53 - Paul: Oh I see. So crimes of passion for example would also be manslaughter
25/04/2021, 20:54 - Paul: Or self defense
25/04/2021, 20:54 - Dayle: Self defence is self defence
25/04/2021, 20:54 - Dayle: Depends on how you defended yourself though
25/04/2021, 20:54 - Paul: But if you kill someone in self defense is it manslaughter
25/04/2021, 20:54 - Dayle: Is it?
25/04/2021, 20:54 - Paul: I dunno
25/04/2021, 20:55 - Lockers: Give me a second I'll ask the English teacher
25/04/2021, 20:55 - Paul: üòÇ
25/04/2021, 20:55 - Dayle: I don't think it is
25/04/2021, 20:56 - Qck: Nah it's radical that's what it is
25/04/2021, 20:56 - Lockers: _radical_
25/04/2021, 20:57 - Dayle: The guy should be fucking shot in the head, prison is to good for that cunt
25/04/2021, 20:57 - Paul: Whoever came up with the term manslaughter really misunderstood the vibe they were going for that it's less severe than murder
25/04/2021, 20:57 - Dayle: If someone shot him would it be self defence if you were vulnerable
25/04/2021, 20:57 - Qck: Who has jerked off more than once today?
25/04/2021, 20:58 - Dayle: üôÖüèª
25/04/2021, 20:58 - James: I'm imagining you, and this is some sort of humble brag you're asking
25/04/2021, 20:58 - Alex: Does it count as jerking off if it isnt premeditated?
25/04/2021, 20:58 - Lockers: Did your dick die?
25/04/2021, 20:58 - Paul: Lmao
25/04/2021, 20:58 - Qck: Haha, no, but these are strong responses already
25/04/2021, 20:59 - Qck: So none of you are gonna own up to it?
25/04/2021, 21:00 - Lockers: Only had one since Wednesday m8
25/04/2021, 21:00 - Paul: 0 times today sorry. Also lost more valorant games than I won so bad day over all

25/04/2021, 21:00 - Lockers: But Derek told me that jerking off makes you better at fps
25/04/2021, 21:00 - James: Who has time to jerk off anymore
25/04/2021, 21:00 - James: Not in this economy
25/04/2021, 21:01 - Lockers: Don't let Mike read this
25/04/2021, 21:01 - Paul: Oh maybe that's the issue
25/04/2021, 21:01 - Lockers: No wait it's the opposite
25/04/2021, 21:01 - Paul: Oh god. So I'd be EVEN WORSE
25/04/2021, 21:02 - Lockers: If that's possible, fkn silver
25/04/2021, 21:03 - Qck: I think you two should take some quality time on eachothers cocks
25/04/2021, 21:03 - Paul: Oh here we go with another one of Sam's fantasies
25/04/2021, 21:03 - Lockers: you'd like that wouldn't you
25/04/2021, 21:05 - Qck: Yeah and I'd like Derek to emerge from the wardrobe and join you on the bed, his nose dripping beads of sweat onto Lockers' naked body. The only thing you're wearing are small fox tails embedded deep within the anal cavity, where only you three trust each other to explore...
25/04/2021, 21:05 - Lockers: Back on the bus, Sam
25/04/2021, 21:06 - Paul: Ok now roll for initiative
25/04/2021, 21:06 - Lockers: is this a dnd joke?
25/04/2021, 21:07 - Qck: Derek rolls a natural one, you can finish it off or let Derek finish you off... whatever floats your boat dude
25/04/2021, 21:08 - Paul: I cast hellfire devil fire. (I'm not evil though)
25/04/2021, 21:08 - Qck: Crumbs, Mike is an evil fucker isn't he
25/04/2021, 21:08 - Paul: If there's one thing I know in life it's never trust a man named Mike
25/04/2021, 21:10 - Alex: My dad left my mum, and he's called paul....
25/04/2021, 21:11 - Lockers: PAUL IS YOUR DAD?!

Big drama in the GTA RP community, relevent to previous GTA post. Chat told this streamer to open his boot when he got in the car and the streamer did without RP reason. META GAMING UH OH.

26/04/2021, 12:13 - Wezz: No wonder he was so angry all the time
26/04/2021, 12:13 - Wezz: Got Kirky hurr durr'ing out mid one banging three noobs while he's shouting at someone to plant for long

26/04/2021, 20:00 - Wezz: I Googled it for you, bigot.

Fortunately, the great people at Women's Health Mag got some 'Experts' to explain it, for ignorant people like you:

‚Äúdigital blackface is when non-Black people use the images and voices of Black individuals to explain emotions or phenomena,‚Äù she goes on to explain in perfect, conscientious, detail:

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs when people use images to claim Black identity, but they don‚Äôt identify as Black.‚Äù

26/04/2021, 23:40 - Paul: Did you know there's a controversial paper written that discusses if Cephalopods, I.e. octopuses actually come from DNA from meteors at the time of the Cambrian explosion? Like they are actually aliens
26/04/2021, 23:45 - Mike: Wouldnt we see other forms of life on many meteors?
26/04/2021, 23:45 - Mike: Or was there just one dope life rock in our past
26/04/2021, 23:46 - Paul: Well the Cambrian explosion was a historic event that was like a jump start to our evolution. So it could have been a bit of a fluke of several perfect storm events I guess
26/04/2021, 23:46 - Mike: Na sounds gay, God did it
26/04/2021, 23:47 - Paul: I mean it's a pretty heavily criticised paper. But still interesting to see theories like that given any credence
26/04/2021, 23:48 - Paul: They point to the super advanced traits that Cephalopods had from a very early stage and how advanced their genome is in comparison to anything else from that era etc
26/04/2021, 23:48 - Wezz: Mate, octopi are crazy. There's a whole book about their nervous system someone was reading at work

27/04/2021, 11:14 - James: Languages follow a distinct pattern in the development of color names.

Primitive languages start with analogs of white and black with everything that is a light color being called white (or their word for white), and everything that is a dark color being called their word for black.

Red is the next color that is added, with their word for red standing for red, yellow, orange, pink, etc. The next step after red is either to create a word to separate yellow from red, or to distinguish green/blue from the other colors.
27/04/2021, 11:14 - James: <Media omitted>
27/04/2021, 11:14 - James: Red Onions and Red Cabbages would have been named before the word for purple was invented.
27/04/2021, 11:16 - James: It's the same reason the colour orange is named after the fruit, as at the time things were referred to as red or yellow-red
27/04/2021, 11:16 - James: orange things were referred*
27/04/2021, 11:26 - Wezz: Thanks James, now if anyone has any questions for James he'd be happy to accept them?
27/04/2021, 11:31 - Mike: I'd like to ask the professor why is he clearly a racist? Each of those lines has white at the top??? And you Mr organiser Wezz, not a single trigger warning was sent out beforehand???
27/04/2021, 11:33 - James: Thank you for the question Mike, what you need to remember is that a lot of these colours predate your 'cancel culture', and I am reporting on history as it is recorded, which is going to have some racial biases. If you would prefer to have a colour development diagram with your rainbow at the top of each section, then please head down the hall as I believe the liberal studies lecture is just about to start. Any other questions?
27/04/2021, 11:35 - Mike: Not even a single use of my preferred pronoun, #CANCELJAMES
27/04/2021, 11:36 - James: Okay, well thank you for living up to the stereotype, I'm going to have to ask you leave my lecture. Some people in this room are still trying to learn.

27/04/2021, 11:43 - James: You know supple is a separate word pronounces differently
27/04/2021, 11:43 - James: Makes it sound quite provocative
27/04/2021, 11:43 - Mike: Thats what I need the million for, advertising using yoga students
27/04/2021, 11:44 - Mike: Healthy, super old, yoga students
27/04/2021, 11:44 - James: Ah, so you're going for the sexy werthers angle
27/04/2021, 11:48 - Mike: My research has shown that the over 80 are the largest demographic that consume mints on a regular basis
27/04/2021, 11:49 - Mike: Around 50% of the million has been ear marked to pay the most attractive exotic yoga teacher money can buy, the tagline? "I love a supple woman"

Crime or not a crime gentlemen?
28/04/2021, 09:10 - Paul: I find it hard to see what crime he actually committed there. Morally it's not really any different than war correspondence or people filming dying kids in Africa instead of helping them. But the guy is a complete psycho for doing it.
28/04/2021, 09:11 - Paul: Definitely seems like an emotional response from the judge more than anything else
28/04/2021, 09:16 - Alex: But the war correspondence is different though? That's for information purposes, then you can debate on the war and stuff, but that's separate
28/04/2021, 09:17 - Paul: Some of it sure. But let's not pretend there isn't a big entertainment factor as well. It brings in massive viewers.
28/04/2021, 09:22 - Alex: Was his even for entertainment? It was just a disgusting video mocking the deaths of 4 people because they had pulled him over for speeding.
28/04/2021, 09:23 - Paul: Well I imagine he found it entertaining
28/04/2021, 09:29 - James: Is there laws to the opposite effect of Good Samaritan laws? Obviously the filming is something that people would disagree with on a personal level which is understandable, but there are countless videos of people ignoring dying individuals on the street and going about their day. As long as this person didn't actively contribute towards the deaths, I agree with Paul. They should be shunned by society for thinking that was appropriate, but it's not breaking laws as far as I am aware.

Outraging public decency really sounds like a catch all for we don't have anything to charge you with but the public want retribution.
28/04/2021, 09:39 - Derren: Probably better to get him some mental help than to arrest him
28/04/2021, 09:56 - Paul: Calls into question what even is a crime at the most fundamental level. Is it just something that the majority of people do not want in our society?
28/04/2021, 09:57 - James: Yeah, but laws exist for a reason right? So that you can't just give mind something as a bad thing and everything is understood in comparison to one another
28/04/2021, 09:58 - James: Obviously I'm not advocating this behaviour, but if people really disagree with this, they need to introduce a law against actively not helping people in danger
28/04/2021, 09:59 - James: I think it's a dangerous precident to be able to decide enough people don't like something that they will imprison someone who hasn't broken laws
28/04/2021, 09:59 - Paul: Interestingly it can be illegal in certain circumstances. When I was a lifeguard there was a weird law that if I'm off duty and see someone struggling then I don't have to help. But then if I start to help and then change my mind that's a crime
28/04/2021, 10:00 - Paul: Oh yeah for sure. I was just thinking about more generally why do we have laws and crimes in the first place. If we think about the function of it
28/04/2021, 10:01 - James: Yeah, I'm sure there are certain circumstances. I wonder if it's the same with "Is anyone a doctor?" Do you need to answer if you are?
28/04/2021, 10:50 - James: https://www.gamingbible.co.uk/news/games-team-fortress-2-this-random-jpg-is-literally-holding-game-together-20210427
28/04/2021, 11:18 - Alex: Isnt that literally how laws work? we make laws and then enact on them
28/04/2021, 11:19 - James: Yeah, but what I am saying that there isn't a law here. I would understand if they decided that not having a law here was bad, and created a law here, but then you can't retroactively punish people for things that weren't against the law at the time
28/04/2021, 11:20 - Alex: Do you know that? I'm not a lawyer and I dont know every Australian law. I read the article and it doesnt say what he was charged with
28/04/2021, 11:20 - Paul: Yeah it does
28/04/2021, 11:21 - James: It says he was charged with the actual crimes, speeding etc, which is fine, and also for outraging public decency
28/04/2021, 11:22 - James: Which as I said above seems like a generic law for what you did felt wrong. I just think it's concerning as if you have fluffy laws then they can be used to an agenda. We can't guarantee that the agenda will be in the public's interest
28/04/2021, 11:24 - James: Again, I want to clarify that I do not condone this person's actions, and I think they are disgusting.
28/04/2021, 11:25 - Alex: But we need fluffy laws for this reason? Humans are not binary and nothing is ever black or white. Then if a judge does this and you disagree that's why we have the court systems to raise it through the courts. So they can judge it separately
28/04/2021, 11:25 - Paul: I feel like this was unnecessary dude no one thinks that little of you lmao
28/04/2021, 11:26 - Alex: Then at the top level it becomes a more political conversation about what we accept as a society
28/04/2021, 11:26 - Paul: I disagree. I think this is one of the worst aspects of law and order.
28/04/2021, 11:26 - James: But what was his crime? Can you specifically pinpoint what he did that was against the law?
28/04/2021, 11:27 - James: Again, ignoring the speeding which he was charged separately for
28/04/2021, 11:27 - Paul: Leaving this up to the specific individual decisions leads to bias and corruption
28/04/2021, 11:27 - Alex: That's literally my entire point and why he was charged with out raging public decency, literally why that law exists. You cannot make a law for literally every possible situation
28/04/2021, 11:28 - Alex: And as I pointed out, it isnt up to specific individuals as that's why you have the appeals process
28/04/2021, 11:28 - Paul: He's just served 10 months for this. Great appeal I guess
28/04/2021, 11:28 - James: I'm genuinely interested in what you think is the part that makes him a criminal here
28/04/2021, 11:29 - Alex: One more time please "outraging public decency"
28/04/2021, 11:29 - Alex: That's the law he broke
28/04/2021, 11:29 - Paul: Define that law
28/04/2021, 11:29 - Alex: So that's what makes him a criminal
28/04/2021, 11:29 - James: Okay, fluffy law aside, what action made him break that law?
28/04/2021, 11:30 - Alex: That's what we decide as a society, and the action of filming and mocking dying police officers. They weren't dead, it was their last moments were an asshole filming and mocking them
28/04/2021, 11:30 - Paul: No one disagrees that what he did makes him an arseholes
28/04/2021, 11:30 - Paul: Arsehole
28/04/2021, 11:31 - Mike: Can we say this once more? I think it's important
28/04/2021, 11:31 - James: Which is abhorrent, but he didn't kill them
28/04/2021, 11:31 - Alex: You just want this guy free in society? I'm not saying prison is the right option, but something needs to be done, because it is completely unacceptable in our society
28/04/2021, 11:31 - Paul: No
28/04/2021, 11:31 - Alex: So then it's a discussion around mental health support and the role of prisons being kinda shit
28/04/2021, 11:32 - James: That's not what we're saying, it's the way in which it was done that is concerning.
28/04/2021, 11:33 - Alex: Being judged in the legal system with a law set up to try and catch this, with extra steps in place to appeal if the initial decision is wrong? The fuckin nerve
28/04/2021, 11:35 - James: It's fine, we have different opinions on this, but I'm trying to look at it from a more objective standpoint. You very much seem to think we're defending the person, so it's not going to go anywhere.
28/04/2021, 11:36 - Alex: We have all unanimously agreed hes a scumbag, I literally never thought you were defending him, but you've also given nothing in terms of a different approach, so it's been useless
28/04/2021, 11:37 - Paul: You can acknowledge that something isn't right without having the perfect solution
28/04/2021, 11:38 - Alex: Of course, but you guys are so militant against this, its strange you have given absolutely no ideas on what to do differently
28/04/2021, 11:40 - Paul: Well I wouldn't arrest this guy. Because I don't think being a weird arsehole should be a crime because it's far to open to interpretation and emotional
28/04/2021, 11:41 - Paul: Far too*
28/04/2021, 11:41 - James: As you said above, I'm not an expert on law, I'm merely expressing concerns that laws can be applied to very emotionally charged and ambiguous situations. You could argue that sharing gore videos from 4Chan ticks the same boxes that this guy did. Would he have had the same charges if he didn't share the video?
28/04/2021, 11:43 - Alex: Hard disagree, he didnt film dead people, he mocked dying people causing them extra distress in the final moments of their lives. He sent the video to friends, none of them were charged, because of course they weren't
28/04/2021, 11:44 - James: I'm not saying you are wrong, you're focused too much on this specific situation
28/04/2021, 11:46 - James: Courts have used previous cases as a precedent for charges, so what I am saying is now this case has been successfully tried under this law, situations like the one I have outlined above could start being cased under the same law.
28/04/2021, 11:46 - Alex: Yeah exactly, and that's good, but if this was the wrong decision as I keep saying there is the courts system to be used to appeal the rulings
28/04/2021, 11:47 - James: As Paul said about, he was sentenced to 10 months, and has been in jail for most of that anyway. How is he going to appeal in the 30 days he has left on his sentence?
28/04/2021, 11:49 - Alex: Well he can appeal to remove this from his record, and to make sure this case couldn't be used in the future. There are plenty of ways the courts system can be improved with how slow it is, but I think that this case is why that law is there, for the grey areas that you cant write specific laws for, but it means that these assholes dont just walk free because the deplorable act wasnt in the books. Then you need the correct checks and balances to make sure that these powers are not then abused of course
28/04/2021, 11:50 - James: I agree, those things listed above can be appealed, but he's still spent 9 months in jail before a sentence was even passed.
28/04/2021, 11:50 - James: I think the argument is boiling down to how much power you think the justice system should have, and how open to interpretation you want the laws.
28/04/2021, 11:51 - James: I think Paul and I would prefer a system with specific laws that are regularly reviewed, where as you would prefer the system to have more interpretation, which is more idealistic and better in theory, but has concerns about abuse of those systems
28/04/2021, 11:53 - James: Neither one of those can be put in place without some issues really, as you highlighted reviewing the laws regularly still means that the first person to commit specific bad acts gets away with it.
28/04/2021, 11:55 - Alex: There will almost always be people unjustly punished in these systems for different reasons, and trying to minimise that should definitely be the goal, and I think why this law looks bad because it leaves a larger gap for unjust punishment to be applied, but I think its finding the right balancing act. In this specific place I think it has definitely been rightly applied, although I'm not sure prison is the right solution, but then that's a whole different argument
28/04/2021, 11:58 - James: I agree, the interesting part that Paul was highlighting was the individual things the person did wasn't actively breaking a law, though combining them all with context made the act much worse. If we are thinking about prison being a place to remove individuals that have proven themselves a danger to society, as you've said, we enter an entirely different conversation as to whether this was a sentence chosen to settle a sense of public vengeance.
28/04/2021, 12:04 - Alex: That's then a debate about the prison system and the large failures to that system, but I dont want to argue that on WhatsApp, i think this is as happy a conclusion as we can reach? Especially debating over messages instead of in person
28/04/2021, 12:05 - James: Yeah, I think that is a separate conversation which from the sounds of it we're already on the same page
28/04/2021, 12:06 - James: Well done everyone, we fixed everything. Proud of us.

28/04/2021, 13:45 - James: It's because they know the lifeguards have it out for them
28/04/2021, 13:45 - James: It's just safer to avoid swimming

28/04/2021, 13:56 - Paul: Is pretending not to see someone the same as actively drowning them? Trolley switch experiment all over again
28/04/2021, 14:00 - James: You see a swimming pool thundering down a track heading to drown a single person, do you throw in 5 more people?
28/04/2021, 14:01 - Alex: Isnt this the tree in the wood? No one is murdered as long as paul doesnt see it?
28/04/2021, 14:02 - James: A pool in the hand is worth 5 in the bush?

28/04/2021, 14:07 - James: Not without resistance
28/04/2021, 14:15 - Paul: Sorry to go back to this but I just caught up. I think if you're looking at this from a statistical point of view, across a normal distribution the vast majority of crimes will be misdemeanors. The further into abstract and broad all-encompassing laws you get. The higher the likelihood that you aren't going to, in a fair system, be able to objectively determine guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. As far as I'm concerned we already probably fuck up a huge amount of prosecutions, but we are meant to operate under the assumption that if someone is going to prison, they are 100% guilty. Holding any other position is just inherently damaging to the whole system. So for the vast majority of crimes committed for petty things that have broad and semantically ambiguous rhetoric, there is a high chance that these people will be unfairly prosecuted. It's the same reason I'm against the death penalty, I'd rather 99 criminals for free than murder 1 innocent man.
28/04/2021, 14:16 - Paul: Went free*
28/04/2021, 14:18 - Piper: floyd mayweather to fight logan paul in june ;X

28/04/2021, 14:24 - Mike: Small cut on one of their eyes, poifect

28/04/2021, 14:25 - Paul: Yeah I just looked seems to be
28/04/2021, 14:29 - Qck: If Floyd actually fights Logan you're watching a 5ft6 man knockout a 6ft2 man
28/04/2021, 14:30 - Qck: Tenshin the greatest Japanese kickboxer in recent memory had a boxing exhibition with Floyd and ended up getting knocked down 3 times in 1 round lmao
28/04/2021, 14:30 - Qck: Dude became a flying fish in the ring
28/04/2021, 14:33 - James: Damn, and his legs are folded 1000 times to strengthen them!
28/04/2021, 14:34 - Paul: Yeah but imagine if he hands a random Haymaker. I mean he's got a huge weight advantage. Would be hilarious
28/04/2021, 14:34 - Paul: Lands
28/04/2021, 14:34 - Qck: Dude is too slow to land a haymaker lmao, 40 year old Floyd was faster than Canelo
28/04/2021, 14:35 - Qck: Floyd is the Magnus Carlsen of boxing bro
28/04/2021, 14:35 - Paul: It would just be so embarrassing for the sport if he clipped him by a fluke and knocked him out lol it's not impossible
28/04/2021, 14:35 - Qck: It's like saying "yeah but Carlsen could lose to fools mate"
28/04/2021, 14:36 - Paul: No it's not even slightly
28/04/2021, 14:36 - Qck: Yeah it really is lmao
28/04/2021, 14:36 - Qck: You really don't think that a guy known for his defensive boxing and his shoulder roll is getting touched lmao
28/04/2021, 14:36 - James: A broken haymaker lands twice a day
28/04/2021, 14:36 - Paul: No I don't think that. Obviously
28/04/2021, 14:36 - Qck: Paul is the reason Logan and Jake get viewers

28/04/2021, 14:39 - Paul: Do you think I don't know how good mayweather is? He's not invincible though and he could make a mistake with the perfect storm of opportunities that could lead to him losing.
28/04/2021, 14:40 - Paul: I just think it would be funny if he fucked up and lost to such a retard
28/04/2021, 14:40 - Qck: Yeah and Carlsen can lose to fools mate
28/04/2021, 14:41 - Paul: They aren't even in the same stratosphere of likelihood
28/04/2021, 14:41 - Qck: You'd be surprised lmao
28/04/2021, 14:41 - Paul: Assuming you mean classical. I've seen Magnus get mated in like 7 moves in blitz
28/04/2021, 14:41 - Qck: Honestly he's the greatest boxer of all time and in his 40s he was still styling on fast fighters, some stocky fuck isn't touching him
28/04/2021, 14:42 - Qck: But I also doubt it happens anyway
28/04/2021, 14:42 - Paul: I doubly hope he beats him now
28/04/2021, 14:42 - Qck: Yeah and you'll be doubly wrong
28/04/2021, 14:43 - Paul: Hoping for something to happen but acknowledging that it 99.999% won't will not make me wrong lol
28/04/2021, 14:52 - Qck: That makes Floyd the betting favourite at -9999900
28/04/2021, 14:53 - Qck: Just gotta put a million on the cunt to get 100 back

28/04/2021, 19:30 - Paul: Is that a requirement to go into business? "Ok Dayle you can be the COO but only if you show up tomorrow wearing 50 t-shirts"

28/04/2021, 20:10 - Lockers: You haven't moaned about marking yet
28/04/2021, 20:10 - Lockers: I don't believe you
28/04/2021, 20:11 - Alex: Ah see those types of english teachers are doing wrong. I teach mostly adults one on one, so quite often it's just conversation and then zero marking, cause that sucks!
28/04/2021, 20:13 - Lockers: Oh do you get dumbasses like Derek his gcses?
28/04/2021, 20:14 - Alex: I have one student who cannot speak english at all, and has never practiced. She wont even say yes or no, just a slight head nod, however after a burnout at work she has decided she must become an english teacher for teenagers, it's strange
28/04/2021, 20:22 - Lockers: She's definitely not ok
28/04/2021, 20:23 - Alex: Yeah, not at all, she said the best place she has ever been is scotland, but doesnt want to go again as the accents are difficult. Instead she would like to visit Ireland.....
28/04/2021, 20:23 - Mike: Fucking lol
28/04/2021, 20:25 - Lockers: Flawless logic, absolutely flawless. How do you know this if she's refusing to speak English? Multilingual?
28/04/2021, 20:33 - Qck: This is the time you tell Lockers you live in France, Alex
28/04/2021, 20:34 - Alex: Lockers, I live in france

30/04/2021, 15:41 - Paul: Well let's be clear. It was between 10 and 12. The last few are always really quick succession
30/04/2021, 15:42 - Kirky: Now you're claiming 12 ? Come on dude get real

02/05/2021, 15:16 - Wezz: It's actually 10x better. Cause people ask questions that actually help them, and use them for continual process of elimination, with time between each one to think about what they could be.

03/05/2021, 13:21 - Mike: Vitalik Buterin Introduction

‚ÄúI was born in 1994 in Russia and moved to Canada in 2000, where I went to school. I happily played World of Warcraft during 2007-2010, but one day Blizzard removed the damage component from my beloved warlock's Siphon Life spell. I cried myself to sleep, and on that day I realized what horrors centralized services can bring. I soon decided to quit.

In 2011, searching for a new purpose in life, I discovered Bitcoin. At first, I was skeptical, and did not understand how it could possibly have value without physical backing. But slowly I became more and more interested. I started writing for a blog called Bitcoin Weekly initially at a meek wage of $1.5 per hour, and soon with Mihai Alisie cofounded Bitcoin Magazine.

In 2012, I entered the University of Waterloo; in 2013 I realized that crypto projects were taking up 30h/week of my time, so I dropped out. I went around the world, explored many crypto projects, and finally realized that they were all too concerned about specific applications and not being sufficiently general - hence the birth of Ethereum, which has been taking up my life ever since.‚Äù

Tldr Blizzard nerfed warlocks and now we have Etherium
03/05/2021, 13:43 - Wezz: @447949324851 LEAGUE?

03/05/2021, 15:05 - Paul: Always down for some 69 action

03/05/2021, 21:34 - Derren: I really enjoyed this video about axe, turndownforwalt tells a very good story about him
03/05/2021, 23:17 - Qck: Well as soon as Dayle hit the Discord I ran out of the bathroom opened a window in the other room stuck my head outside, breathed in and out a lot, opened the rest of the windows, held a breath from outside, covered my face flushed the toilet, repeat a few times then left the house for 2h

05/05/2021, 22:21 - Mike: Could be dope, beats the Skyrim copy paste caves
05/05/2021, 22:52 - James: On the other hand, it will vary based on the level of input and assets they give it. It could very much be copy paste caves.

Pretty shocking they didn't get a payout from this, I thought it was gonna be millions üòµ
06/05/2021, 15:01 - Wezz: I love being a cunt; but surely if you have a severe allergy to something you check absolutely everywhere you dine RE it's presence. It says he did, guess the evidence for that was contested üëÄ
06/05/2021, 15:01 - Paul: Yeah that's surprising, seems like he made every effort to inform them of his allergy and they fucked up
06/05/2021, 15:02 - Wezz: Other than your emotional response; where are you seeing that 'he made every effort to inform them'?
06/05/2021, 15:02 - Wezz: Did he jump on the counter and do the allergy dance?
06/05/2021, 15:02 - Paul: "He informed staff about his allergy but was not told buttermilk was included. He collapsed and died shortly later."
06/05/2021, 15:05 - Wezz: When I was 18 I could barely inform the staff of what I wanted to order. But yeah, it'll lead to some positive changes regarding regulation. Darwin theory continues in the meantime.
06/05/2021, 15:06 - Paul: You really think it's in some way his own fault? Someone with a deadly allergy knows exactly what they need to avoid at 18.
06/05/2021, 15:06 - Wezz: Just to reiterate, I did preface this by saying "I love being a cunt".
06/05/2021, 15:07 - Wezz: I think if his parents had evidence he allergy checked the restaurant and they said "you're good to go" then they'd be getting a huge payout right now.
06/05/2021, 15:08 - Paul: But isn't that exactly why its all over the news now? Because that didn't happen and its surprising.
06/05/2021, 15:09 - Wezz: It's surprising to readers who immediately assume he "made every effort to inform them". Whereas he may have mumbled it and not waited for an answer. Reality is, we don't know.
06/05/2021, 15:09 - Paul: I'm going by what evidence we've been given.
06/05/2021, 15:10 - Wezz: You're responding to sensationalist headlines like you're supposed to.
06/05/2021, 15:11 - Paul: But I'm not the one assuming things, you are...
06/05/2021, 15:14 - Wezz: I'm saying "we don't know".
06/05/2021, 15:15 - Wezz: Clearly we don't have the court case level information that was made to make this decision. Does corruption occur in court, of course. But you have to put some faith somewhere, mine certainly doesn't stand with the media.
06/05/2021, 15:15 - Paul: And I'm saying that's a weird take as it doesn't imply anywhere that it's even controversial. You're speculating something randomly
06/05/2021, 15:16 - Derren: If I have a deathly allergy I'm not eating anywhere except my own house
06/05/2021, 15:18 - Wezz: Well the court case outcome was against popular opinion right? That's the controversy. I'm trying to subtract the emotional response from the situation and look at what's left. Courts clearly saw something different than the press, you just want to ignore that and shout injustice? That's cool
06/05/2021, 15:31 - Paul: I mean whether or not he "asked correctly or just mumbled it" wasn't even in question as far as I could see. Regardless of how emotional you think my reaction is. I'm going by what the "facts" (reporting) tells us. I dunno why you think that means I'm buying into sensationalist rhetoric or something. It gave no mention of how the courts reacted so it's kinda baseless speculation from your part.
06/05/2021, 15:32 - Qck: Wezz and Paul, it's Wezz and Paul, what are they arguing? Who has bigger balls?
06/05/2021, 15:32 - Qck: It's Wezz case dismissed
06/05/2021, 15:32 - Wezz: But my balls are TINY
06/05/2021, 15:33 - Wezz: Microscopic Ball Paul?
06/05/2021, 15:33 - Qck: Take that as a metaphor for the arguments you win off Paul
06/05/2021, 15:33 - Paul: I saw a picture of myself as a baby once and my balls were GIGANTIC. I don't think they've grown since
06/05/2021, 15:34 - Qck: Ask your mum for evidence or I'm not allowing this origin story
06/05/2021, 15:34 - Wezz: Yeah it's cool, literally not disagreeing with you. Being upset is the default response and is completely normal/correct/whatever. I just wanted to go beyond that a little.
06/05/2021, 15:35 - Paul: Fuck you bitch
06/05/2021, 15:36 - Wezz: Also your quote isn't a quote. Can't just stick speech marks around anything, Jesus.
06/05/2021, 15:39 - Dayle: <Media omitted>
06/05/2021, 15:39 - Paul: Eww diet coke
06/05/2021, 15:40 - Wezz: It's funny how I come from a different angle and it's like Oh, so you wanted the kid to die huh? You wanted them to marinade him in buttermilk chained in the basement of a closed down Byron's? Captain Byron basting his histamine filled lungs?

Nah, I'm just searching for some reasons, s'all
06/05/2021, 15:41 - Qck: Cutting down on your daily intake of bread I see
06/05/2021, 15:41 - Dayle: yeah bro down 10lb
06/05/2021, 15:41 - Qck: Now you only eat 5lbs of bread
06/05/2021, 15:43 - Dayle: true - but i was outside in lovely weather enjoying my self and my life so... fuck your 5lbs :) ill burn it off in the pool
06/05/2021, 15:43 - Mike: I'm inclined to believe the BBC if they report "He informed staff about his allergy but was not told buttermilk was included. He collapsed and died shortly later."
06/05/2021, 15:43 - Qck: Oh get a load of this cunt outside again
06/05/2021, 15:44 - Paul: <Media omitted>
06/05/2021, 15:44 - Mike: But interesting to see how it goes though, maybe he did send an email and the waiter never saw it but I think that's be fairly obvious information to a reporter
06/05/2021, 15:44 - Qck: Yeah plus a weird lettered apology and an update to their menu to include buttermilk in the ingredients - we just don't live in the US where wrongful death always equals mega bux
06/05/2021, 15:45 - Dayle left
06/05/2021, 15:45 - Qck: Uh oh
06/05/2021, 15:45 - Paul: lmao jesus christ Dayle
06/05/2021, 15:45 - Qck: He's fully gone outside
06/05/2021, 15:45 - Wezz: No one's contesting if the kid died... lol. Remove that from the quote and you have the details that are significant to the courts.
06/05/2021, 15:46 - Paul: No Wezz you think he's still alive and it's BULLSHIT
06/05/2021, 15:46 - Wezz: Looool, THE KID'S NOT DEAD
06/05/2021, 15:46 - Wezz: You're all sheeple.
06/05/2021, 15:46 - Wezz: Dayle knows the truth
06/05/2021, 15:47 - Mike: Further evidence the kid died "A coroner ruled in 2019 that Mr Carey, from Crowborough, Sussex, was not told about allergens that led to his death."
06/05/2021, 15:47 - Mike: But maybe he mumbled it agreed
06/05/2021, 15:47 - Qck: Remove the quoted text and then you just have a man saying nothing to a reporter, so yeah, the kid's not dead
06/05/2021, 15:48 - Wezz: So if he mentioned it to the staff, it's an open shut case where restaurant is liable. Obviously that wasn't provable. That's my point. But I'll go back to basting my next victims no big deal
06/05/2021, 15:48 - Mike: Why is the coroner weighing in whether he was informed of his meal's ingredients? "Yeh this corpse is consistent with a well informed man"
06/05/2021, 15:48 - Paul: Coroners often perform the investigation about what lead to the death
06/05/2021, 15:49 - Wezz: Look okay, I know Owen well. He was always great with explaining his allergies.
06/05/2021, 15:49 - Qck: Restaurant was liable but they finangled their insurance to pay out sheckles instead of dollarydoos is how I read it (I didn't read it)
06/05/2021, 15:49 - Mike: More than the objective? Never heard of that, thought that was cops jobby
06/05/2021, 15:50 - Mike: They paid out in safemoon and saved millions
06/05/2021, 15:50 - Wezz: Dayle's not here to appreciate that ü•≤
06/05/2021, 15:50 - Wezz: You should write a newspaper column, I'd skim read it at lunch
06/05/2021, 15:51 - Wezz: That's my biggest compliment
06/05/2021, 15:51 - Qck: Fax it to his raspberry pi
06/05/2021, 15:51 - Mike: Didn't see he left, zinger wasted on kirky
06/05/2021, 15:51 - Wezz: New question; how many people will Dayle eliminate from his life before he turns to introspection?
06/05/2021, 15:52 - Qck: Just read old Maddox articles for that sort of stuff, also free speech laws in England would mean I'd be sharing a cell with the Hitler dog guy
06/05/2021, 15:52 - Mike: He'll be back before league this evening or ill drag him
06/05/2021, 15:52 - Qck: How much bread is he gonna comfort eat is my question and is it gonna be more than 5lbs
06/05/2021, 15:55 - Mike: Equation for that: üçû / üèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
06/05/2021, 15:56 - Wezz: couple laps / couple baps
06/05/2021, 15:57 - Mike: I ate nandos extra hot sauce today, did not cry like a baby. Proud of me @447835575116 ?
06/05/2021, 15:58 - Paul: A coroner is a government or judicial official who is empowered to conduct or order an inquest into the manner or cause of death, and to investigate or confirm the identity of an unknown person who has been found dead within the coroner's jurisdiction
06/05/2021, 15:58 - Paul: Seems within lines of the objective to me
06/05/2021, 15:58 - Paul: Usually when there is a suspicious death they do extra investigation at the request of the family. They did for Chris' death for example
06/05/2021, 15:59 - Mike: Cause = allergic reaction
Or
Cause = lack of reading ingredients

But I get your point
06/05/2021, 15:59 - Paul: The really hot one? Or just the hot one
06/05/2021, 16:00 - Paul: Yes but does that cover manner as well?????????????????
06/05/2021, 16:01 - Mike: Just extra hot, not the new Vusa shit which is pretty much guaranteed to light your arse on fire apparently.

 Funny cos you can order a nandinosüëès kids meal and ask for Vusa sauce, I assume as some kind of punishment.
06/05/2021, 16:01 - Wezz: That Vusa stuff is mental...
06/05/2021, 16:01 - Paul: Extra hot is pretty hardcore though, so well done
06/05/2021, 16:02 - Qck: 5lbs üçû (5500 calories approx.) / üèä= 400 üèä mins ‚åöin a 50müèù poolüö£
06/05/2021, 16:02 - Mike: Yeh but I'll skip the crust
06/05/2021, 16:02 - Qck: That's an estimate using a 300lb man doing a front crawl
06/05/2021, 16:03 - Qck: All assumptions just like Wezz and that dead kid
06/05/2021, 16:03 - Wezz: Is the extra hot the matt black one? Looks like a strip club?
06/05/2021, 16:03 - Paul: I don't remember, I just remember it being pretty spicy, especially for Mike's weak constitution
06/05/2021, 16:04 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
06/05/2021, 16:05 - Paul: Can we use metric please this lb shit can fuck right off
06/05/2021, 16:05 - Paul: That's the one
06/05/2021, 16:05 - Wezz: You'll be pleased to know I only assume when it comes to dead kids
06/05/2021, 16:07 - Paul: Mike doing more work than his Marketing team atm
06/05/2021, 16:08 - Wezz: Massive difference in skills required to determine between these by the way. Kinda my original point, the courts obv had a different view of things. But when I mentioned it I got a German pitchfork to the eye
06/05/2021, 16:09 - Paul: You even prefaced it by saying you were being a cunt lol
06/05/2021, 16:10 - Qck: Here's a cool read for the two people in chat who didn't stutter when they read Mice and Men outloud in year 9
06/05/2021, 16:10 - Qck: https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/john-swartzwelder-sage-of-the-simpsons
06/05/2021, 16:11 - Qck: Also general Simpsons fans
06/05/2021, 16:11 - Wezz: Yeah - was kinda hoping the contrarian view would be better accommodated by big brain individuals. The time is not now Wezz, stay in hiding until next decade
06/05/2021, 16:12 - Wezz: Damn, got me again... always showing off
06/05/2021, 16:13 - Qck: Even insults that seem pointedly aimed at Dayle are really for you fatty
06/05/2021, 16:19 - Kirky: This message was deleted
06/05/2021, 16:19 - Wezz: My paranoia and insecurities already kicked in, went running last week and almost died. Think I've replaced my alveoli with breadcrumbs
06/05/2021, 16:19 - Kirky: Actually this is I didnt catch up before responding
06/05/2021, 16:21 - Wezz: ...mate, you weren't supposed to show off our love hearts in chat. We were going to tell everyone in person (!)
06/05/2021, 16:21 - Wezz: Guys... me and Kirky have been hiding something from you
06/05/2021, 16:21 - Kirky: notihng to see here
06/05/2021, 16:22 - Wezz: Looool
06/05/2021, 16:22 - Qck: Lmao, knew something was suss from the amount of duo you played
06/05/2021, 16:23 - Wezz: What can I say; we're sadists
06/05/2021, 16:29 - Mike: I get commission
06/05/2021, 16:41 - Paul: Brain size isn't a great indication of intelligence though
06/05/2021, 16:42 - Wezz: Dick size is a great indication of confidence though
06/05/2021, 16:42 - Wezz: So, Poker tomorrow?
06/05/2021, 16:42 - Wezz: FRIDAY NIGHT POKER NIGHT
06/05/2021, 16:43 - Wezz: Thinking of doing two games. First one at 8pm? Second at ~10pm.
06/05/2021, 16:43 - Paul: Yeah can't wait to take everyones money
06/05/2021, 16:43 - Paul: Is the late night game for the REAL gamers?
06/05/2021, 16:44 - Wezz: Last time I did it, set up a PayPal Pool for people to pay into. We did ¬£10, but shall we do smaller? ¬£5 in each?
06/05/2021, 16:45 - Qck: Yeah I'm not doing a fiver, I'll do a quid per round and spend my money on beers thanks
06/05/2021, 16:45 - Paul: I was thinking 50
06/05/2021, 16:45 - Wezz: Something along the lines of (8 x ¬£5):
1st: ¬£25
2nd: ¬£10
3rd: ¬£5

Any extra goes to the top. Rebuys for first hour of the game.
06/05/2021, 16:46 - Qck: Bruh no rebuys either what is you doing
06/05/2021, 16:46 - Paul: First place 40 everyone else goes away like a bitch
06/05/2021, 16:46 - Qck: Is this one of those things where Wezz sticks his dick in the soup
06/05/2021, 16:47 - Wezz: Rebuys are optional. Just means if you bust before 9pm you can buy in again, usually people are supportive of it cause it means whales like Mike can rebuy 5 times before 8:10pm
06/05/2021, 16:47 - Paul: Could just do cash games if its less controversial
06/05/2021, 16:47 - Wezz: If you bust you can just chill and drink, doesn't matter. There're also music rules to the game
06/05/2021, 16:47 - Qck: Rebuys are for fags that aren't on the final table
06/05/2021, 16:49 - Wezz: Well, if you guys trust me to organise it, It'll be the perfect beginners poker session with lots of fun/drinking/music.

No one's any good anyway, pretty much just Piper who plays regularly right?
06/05/2021, 16:49 - Qck: Bruh I don't wanna be playing for a 90 pound pot against Piper because Mike's rebought in 6 times to see if his aces will stick
06/05/2021, 16:53 - Wezz: You'd still only be in for a 5er, easy moolah
06/05/2021, 16:57 - Mike: I won't be rebuying, poker holds my attention until about 2 drinks deep
06/05/2021, 16:57 - Mike: I'll be all-in busting before then
06/05/2021, 16:58 - Paul: And then just sit there twiddling your thumbs?
06/05/2021, 16:58 - Mike: Then it's back on the league train üöÜ
06/05/2021, 16:58 - Paul: Oh fuck off
06/05/2021, 16:58 - Mike: Or Mordhau, I'm not fussy
06/05/2021, 17:07 - Paul: Maybe we can do a poll of what buy-in people would prefer? Don't wanna exclude anyone as it's just for fun anyway
06/05/2021, 17:10 - Paul: <Media omitted>

06/05/2021, 17:32 - Qck: Then you make your own poll with all three as one option and then you poopy
06/05/2021, 17:32 - Paul: I voted for ;dropTable
06/05/2021, 17:42 - Alex: We playing friday or Saturday?

06/05/2021, 17:52 - Qck: "Did this nigga Dayle..."

Yes.
Whatever your sentence, yes.
06/05/2021, 18:23 - Paul: Whose voting on that poll from amsterdam, VPN boys step forward

06/05/2021, 18:39 - Wezz: This is crazy, had a search and can see most studies ask for recollection of public events etc. But also days retrograde amnesia is when someone has a previous 'blind spot' but can since form new recent memories
06/05/2021, 18:39 - Wezz: Kinda different than what that graph shows
06/05/2021, 18:39 - Wezz: They call me no fun wezz
06/05/2021, 18:40 - Wezz: *Did you know:*

Perhaps the best-known example of retrograde amnesia actually turned out to be a scam.

"Philip Staufen" (actually the name of a medieval German king, but it was the first name the man came up with when he woke up), also known as Mr. Nobody, was a man, in his late twenties and with a slight Yorkshire English accent but no other identification, who awoke in a Toronto hospital in 1999 with what appeared to be severe retrograde or global amnesia.

After various attempts to obtain Canadian citizenship and to legally change his name, he turned out to be a Romanian called Sywalkd Skeid, and to exhibit no clinical evidence of amnesia at all.
06/05/2021, 18:43 - Paul: theres a few semantic memory tests we do, famous faces, news events tests, in the US they do the presidents test, autobiographical memory is just usually incredibly hard to verify
06/05/2021, 18:45 - Wezz: Is it super easy? Would we all get max marks?
06/05/2021, 18:45 - Paul: <Media omitted>
06/05/2021, 18:46 - Paul: you might have heard of Patient HM, most famous example of anterograde amnesia
06/05/2021, 18:48 - Paul: They tailor it to the individual and the time frame they want to look at. So if they want to look at different decades they show, for example, very famous faces from the 1960s 70s, 80s, 90s. And they can track, on average, participants ability to recognise/name them
06/05/2021, 18:48 - Paul: the example test from my old lectures was pretty hilarious as I only recognised like 3 people on it
06/05/2021, 18:49 - Paul: <Media omitted>
06/05/2021, 18:50 - Wezz: Thanks - makes sense. I always assumed amnesia was degenerative, a symptom of Alzheimer's. Cool to know I could just selectively forget about losing my virginity.
06/05/2021, 18:51 - Paul: It can be, but there are tons of ways to get amnesia, stroke, tumours, injury, seizures, alcohol abuse, drugs, psychological trauma
06/05/2021, 18:52 - Wezz: Maybe it's what happened to the Mother Mary.
06/05/2021, 18:52 - Wezz: Where's the hot tub meta on Twitch?
06/05/2021, 18:53 - Paul: HM for example, got his after an overzealous doctor removed part of his medial temporal lobe to try and fix his seizures, he gave him a permanent inability to create new memories and didnt even cure the seizures
06/05/2021, 18:53 - Paul: your test would be full of twitch streams, porn stars and LoL characters
06/05/2021, 18:53 - Wezz: _Perfect_
06/05/2021, 18:54 - Wezz: Yeah, this is gnarly. Reading about it now. Standard consent process controversy around vulnerable adults. Bloody doctors, when you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail.
06/05/2021, 23:30 - Kirky: As dayle isnt here anymore I guess it's on me to give you the updates

07/05/2021, 08:01 - Derren: ü§è
07/05/2021, 08:02 - Derren: You are the the psychologist, that's your responsibility to answer
07/05/2021, 08:44 - Paul: Just like me, drew longs to be
07/05/2021, 08:45 - Wezz: Close to Drew...
07/05/2021, 08:45 - Wezz: On the day that drew was born
07/05/2021, 08:48 - Paul: No one remembers the chorus lyrics m8

07/05/2021, 09:17 - Paul: Churches are tall because we want them to look like erect penises
07/05/2021, 09:21 - Derren: WE PLAYING SWORD OF LEGENDS ONLINE WHEN IT COMES OUT IN SUMMER?
07/05/2021, 09:29 - James: I don't even know if that's a real game, or just a mashup of generic game words

07/05/2021, 09:56 - Noone: New mmo? I'm sure me and kirky will check it out
07/05/2021, 09:57 - Derren: It's a chinese mmo, been out there for a couple of years but being released in the west this summer
07/05/2021, 09:57 - Noone: Chinkshit confirmed but no cash shop so interesting
07/05/2021, 09:58 - Noone: Not played a new subscription mmo in... A decade? I'll play it for sure
07/05/2021, 09:59 - Derren: It's not sub based jack
07/05/2021, 09:59 - Derren: It's like gw, buy the game and it's f2p I believe, cash shop exists but only cosmetics (mounts/skins etc)
07/05/2021, 10:04 - Noone: Oh lazy peon vid said it was sub

07/05/2021, 10:55 - Qck: Doesn't SoL have gender locked classes and isn't played in China or am I wrong?

TBC monetization is funny, only thing that's mental is the 20 pounds you pay to keep your character in classic, but I'm not the type of dude who cares about cosmetics
07/05/2021, 10:56 - Qck: So who cares if you get a fag mount and everyone knows you're a sad sack who paid 70 pounds to show it off
07/05/2021, 11:00 - Piper: ill give it a go
07/05/2021, 11:06 - Derren: It's a Chinese mmo
07/05/2021, 11:06 - Derren: And it doesbt have gender lock atm
07/05/2021, 11:06 - Derren: No I've seen him play games I played and understood in my teens very easily yet he seems to find very simple things difficult to do
07/05/2021, 11:11 - Qck: https://i.imgur.com/khI6PcF.png
07/05/2021, 11:12 - Qck: Can't wait to see the male counterpart to that class
07/05/2021, 11:17 - James: It's the same character model with a bulge
07/05/2021, 11:17 - Qck: You're supposed to keep this kind of filth within the confines of Monday night DnD
07/05/2021, 11:19 - James: Sorry, I'm brimming too early, I'll be drained by Monday at this rate. I'll go back to sexy dancers and tentacle encounters in the confines of our shared imagination.
07/05/2021, 11:39 - Wezz: Of all the collective minds to combine. You five on a Monday eve is most repulsive to me
07/05/2021, 11:40 - Qck: We all meld into one giant Paul
07/05/2021, 11:44 - Wezz: Less repulsive, more repaulsive
07/05/2021, 11:50 - Wezz: Has anyone invited Dayle back into the group? I vote QCK should do it, need some Friday drama in my life

07/05/2021, 11:59 - Paul: Gender locked classes takes me back to Mu Online
07/05/2021, 12:00 - Qck: And those lolicon models take you back to your morning wank
07/05/2021, 12:00 - Paul: I feel like we wait for him to come crawling back or we are just enabling this behaviour üê¶
07/05/2021, 12:00 - Qck: I'm with Dr. Fishchops here
07/05/2021, 12:03 - James: Black Desert had waifu specific classes as well right?
07/05/2021, 12:03 - Paul: Or we let Lockers invite him back
07/05/2021, 12:03 - Qck: Let's take a poll and see what David in Brooklyn Heights thinks first
07/05/2021, 12:03 - Paul: Only played it briefly can't remember
07/05/2021, 12:04 - Kirky: Yes
07/05/2021, 12:04 - Wezz: If Dr Fishbags had his way he'd pseudonymise him and whip out the Rorschach inkblots
07/05/2021, 12:05 - Paul: If I'm already getting called Dr wtf is the point of this phd
07/05/2021, 12:06 - Wezz: Is he our friend or a clinical trial subject?

Zoidberg?
07/05/2021, 12:06 - Wezz: I'll use your correct surname on completion, until then you're Dr Fishfood
07/05/2021, 12:08 - Wezz: Also I fail to see why we care about gender assignment in a game? You're already playing a Chinese mmorpg, dignity is not of concern.
07/05/2021, 12:11 - Qck: I think it more points towards cutting corners than being upset that your game doesn't have little boy fucktoys
07/05/2021, 12:12 - Wezz: Corners we're concerned about? I'd rather the sword made a slightly nicer swinging sound than my shota dreams be fulfilled.
07/05/2021, 12:17 - Paul: I like my games perfectly round
07/05/2021, 12:22 - Piper: Corners are specifically dangerous in football especially when the opposing team have tall players

07/05/2021, 17:25 - Wezz: How many corners does a football have?
07/05/2021, 17:29 - Lockers: Trick question

07/05/2021, 22:11 - Kirky: I'm literally dead sober, out of alcohol, and they're all drunken rambling üôÑ
07/05/2021, 22:11 - Kirky: Lockdown has ruined me

08/05/2021, 11:05 - Wezz: GGs enjoyed the poker. Gratz to Alex/QCK. Taking home ¬£85 between them ü•áü•à
08/05/2021, 11:27 - James: Yeah, was good fun, up for another one at some point, as long as:
- people who play want to play
- we avoid mid game economic crises
08/05/2021, 11:35 - Mike: Feel like third place should have gotten all of Dayles money to make it fair
08/05/2021, 11:39 - Alex: Fuck you
08/05/2021, 11:40 - Mike: Don't look at me m8 my name was pipMcGee
08/05/2021, 11:40 - Alex: Please no
08/05/2021, 11:45 - Mike: Think we'd have to play for ¬£1 a buy in to ensure economic reliability amongst friends, as Qck suggested
08/05/2021, 11:49 - Alex: I enjoyed a taste of the 1% life, I now realise why they hate the poor so much
08/05/2021, 12:10 - Wezz: I agree - I have no conflict of interest.
08/05/2021, 12:11 - Mike: Let it be on the record that, in a drunken stupor, I consumed Jack's favourite ready meal. I have no regrets.
08/05/2021, 12:11 - Mike: Next question.
08/05/2021, 12:13 - Wezz: Agree, I'll add:
- zero tolerance to the boring 12-year-old epeen chatter between qck and dayle

Makes me self conscious of my 1 incher
08/05/2021, 12:15 - Mike: Almost as bad as me giving life advice 7 shots deep
08/05/2021, 12:15 - Mike: You should buy that boat btw Wezz, good investment
08/05/2021, 12:16 - Wezz: yeah you can fuck off too, had the mental tenacity of a banana
08/05/2021, 12:17 - Mike: I never claimed otherwise, also good reminder I need a banana
08/05/2021, 12:17 - Paul: +1 next time let's check that people playing actually want to play so there's less bitching
08/05/2021, 12:19 - Wezz: I think it was just revenge for all the times we've shit on your new games
08/05/2021, 12:19 - Mike: Sorry but no can do, I wouldnt get to see Julia complain about you on cam then
08/05/2021, 12:20 - Paul: In regards to this I think it's fair to say that only 1 person was actually taking that seriously
08/05/2021, 12:20 - Mike: Dayles bank account?
08/05/2021, 12:21 - Paul: That's a lost cause
08/05/2021, 12:32 - Paul: Wezz I'm not familiar with your late night antics but that's the second time you've done the old Irish goodbye and just disappeared. Is this a regular occurrence?
08/05/2021, 12:39 - Wezz: Let's be real, making Dayle mad is like taking candy from a quadriplegic child
08/05/2021, 12:40 - Paul: Easy and rewarding?
08/05/2021, 12:42 - Wezz: Yeah sorry, I had to call my Chiropodist about my foot, they said I have a huge penis.
08/05/2021, 12:43 - Wezz: He just doesn't stop screaming..
08/05/2021, 12:55 - Derren: What's wrong with screaming :o
08/05/2021, 12:56 - Derren: I enjoyed the qck vs dayle into the early hours of the morning
08/05/2021, 12:56 - Derren: Even got flashed at 2am
08/05/2021, 12:56 - Mike: Maybe people should stop prodding Dayle and then being surprised when he reacts
08/05/2021, 12:57 - Derren: I don't think anybody was surprised mike
08/05/2021, 12:57 - Wezz: I mean, QCK knew what he was doing lol.
08/05/2021, 13:46 - Wezz: but yeah, any big group on discord irish goodbye is the way.
08/05/2021, 13:51 - Kirky: fuck off you do that when its 5 of us playing league

08/05/2021, 13:54 - Kirky: yea sorry i have to wake up at 530am :(
08/05/2021, 13:54 - Kirky: i hate it
08/05/2021, 13:55 - Kirky: find me a job that pays 25k a year and lets me finish at 2pm most days, work outside, and walk 12k steps a day and ill change it just so i can play league
08/05/2021, 13:56 - Wezz: just be a degen and get 4 hours of sleep each night like I do
08/05/2021, 13:57 - Kirky: i literally cant anymore it kills me üòí walking around at work on edge wanting to kick all the dogs
08/05/2021, 14:02 - Qck: Oh yeah Dayle was reacting last night but who was prodding him lmao
08/05/2021, 14:03 - Lockers: Why
08/05/2021, 14:04 - Qck: Ey Dayle bet you can't talk for 2 hours straight before doing a weird cry when people ask you to stop - nobody
08/05/2021, 14:04 - Kirky: @447943624891 @447949324851 CLASHCLASH?
08/05/2021, 14:04 - Wezz: did he do a weird cry?
08/05/2021, 14:04 - Qck: Lmao
08/05/2021, 14:04 - Wezz: did i miss it/
08/05/2021, 14:05 - Qck: I won't respond to his tears last night nor how I tried to resolve his bitter outcry
08/05/2021, 14:05 - Qck: Better left unsaid
08/05/2021, 14:05 - Wezz: "tried to resolve"
08/05/2021, 14:06 - Qck: Bro I ran into the webcam shot spinning my cock around as he weeped about his mum (we weren't talking about mums)
08/05/2021, 14:07 - Qck: He hated that even more than his mum judging by his additional outrage and offerings to see me when he sees me
08/05/2021, 14:07 - Wezz: You tried the helicopter topic change?
08/05/2021, 14:08 - Qck: Successfully as well I might add
08/05/2021, 14:08 - Wezz: That's an advanced strat
08/05/2021, 14:08 - Qck: Dayle went from holding his push to talk down for 10 minutes at a time to some real wonky radio silence from Thanet
08/05/2021, 14:10 - Wezz: Glad I left when I did - although disappointed I didn't get to see your penis
08/05/2021, 14:12 - Qck: Ah you should have grinded through to the end game, I know I'm not allowed to sleep until trisrebel enters a voice channel and starts reminiscing back to a situation that I definitely wasn't a part of
08/05/2021, 14:13 - Mike: We grabbing Chinese ATM
08/05/2021, 14:16 - Derren: electrician!

09/05/2021, 12:01 - Wezz: So _that's_ why you were crushing league

10/05/2021, 09:25 - Mike: I thought I dreamt that
10/05/2021, 09:28 - Paul: Call it BlTCOIN but that's actually a lower case L

10/05/2021, 12:18 - Derren: Why would somebody trust a celeb o.o

10/05/2021, 12:42 - Mike: The best use case I've seen so far for NFTs is a digital cat game where each NFT is used by the app to generate a unique cat
10/05/2021, 12:43 - Mike: Unfortunately its a digital cat game, pokemon without the nostalgia or fun game elements

10/05/2021, 13:13 - Paul: Is this thing on??

10/05/2021, 14:06 - Qck: Yeah, did you teach the lesson but in rap form?
10/05/2021, 14:07 - James: "Now when you really think about it kids, Freud was the Tupac of his time. Don't think of me teaching you psychology, think of this a big rap jam, yo"

10/05/2021, 14:45 - Wezz: Still makes me laugh now, goddammit.

10/05/2021, 15:45 - Paul: But Derren is our Elon and he just crashed it
10/05/2021, 15:46 - Wezz: Where we're going we won't need Derek, just his digital endorsement
10/05/2021, 15:46 - Derren: You're not allowed to be racist towards oriental asians around mike, he gets offended
10/05/2021, 15:47 - Wezz: I didn't name it, don't blame me.
10/05/2021, 15:48 - Kirky: antiblack racism only please. you know, REAL racism

10/05/2021, 16:49 - Piper: Those damn pipers shitting on my lawn again
10/05/2021, 17:56 - Wezz: Mike, I have an idea.

If I come over to yours and feed you onion while you wear a blind fold and you no-sell it like "mmmm lovely apple" we could go VIRAL
10/05/2021, 18:04 - Wezz: Then after, we keep the blindfold on and Jack walks in wearing his underpants and gets his head stuck in the washing machine. Cue step-bro onion breath sexy music
10/05/2021, 18:06 - Mike: You had me at onions but lost me at Jack
10/05/2021, 18:07 - Wezz: You carve a tunnel through an onion, then use it as a fleshlight to make your dick cry cum
10/05/2021, 18:07 - Wezz: That's enough WhatsApp for me today
10/05/2021, 19:51 - James: Oh but I was so close!

11/05/2021, 10:49 - Kirky: Lesbian vibes atleast
11/05/2021, 10:49 - Kirky: Ikr it's not even a fucking real gun
11/05/2021, 10:49 - Kirky: I'm almost offended, am I not worth actually shooting guys ? ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫
11/05/2021, 10:49 - Paul: I used to have a few BB guns. Was cool
11/05/2021, 10:50 - Kirky: On your employees?
11/05/2021, 10:51 - Kirky: By this I mean short stocky short hair trousers shirts, so no
11/05/2021, 10:51 - Paul: I think that was clear üòâ
11/05/2021, 10:52 - Kirky: Idk you guys mightve taken it as massive boobs 6ft blonde porn star lesbian
11/05/2021, 10:53 - Derren: Maybe he was sad and wanted to invited everybody out for an outdoors bb session
11/05/2021, 10:54 - James: If you want to be the office fun guy, bring a nerf gun or something, not something you will look like a school shooter with
11/05/2021, 10:54 - Paul: Says the samurai sword umbrella guy
11/05/2021, 10:55 - James: Yeah, and everyone thought I was a step away from a trenchcoat and a body count
11/05/2021, 11:01 - Wezz: After yesterday's insecurities, lol.
11/05/2021, 11:03 - Wezz: What a cringelord, stick his BB gun in his japseye
11/05/2021, 11:03 - Wezz: Holy shit
11/05/2021, 11:03 - Wezz: Japs eye
11/05/2021, 11:03 - Qck: Lmao, a photo of his ex-wife, a fifth of whiskey and a bb gun - going out how he came in: a mess
11/05/2021, 11:04 - Wezz: Is that actually where it comes from ?
11/05/2021, 11:05 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
11/05/2021, 11:05 - Qck: ???
11/05/2021, 11:05 - Qck: <Media omitted>
11/05/2021, 11:06 - James: No, it's because it is meant to look like a Japanese persons eye. I hope you've used it in official research papers
11/05/2021, 11:07 - Qck: I call it my Gook Peeper
11/05/2021, 11:07 - Wezz: Fortunately I don't go around shouting about Japs eyes with my colleagues. That's an awful slur. Feel a sense of dread having said it around friends in the past
11/05/2021, 11:08 - Qck: Have a think about it on the way to the paki shop or mull over it this evening over a nice chinky
11/05/2021, 11:09 - Wezz: There's no good alternative, what do you guys call the slit at the end of your peni?
11/05/2021, 11:09 - James: We just thought you were a massive racist
11/05/2021, 11:09 - Wezz: Need some advice, friends
11/05/2021, 11:09 - James: It's a urethra
11/05/2021, 11:10 - Wezz: Thought that was the whole tube and stuff.
11/05/2021, 11:10 - Wezz: (medical phraseology)
11/05/2021, 11:10 - Qck: It's the urethus meatus bro it says so on your Google
11/05/2021, 11:10 - James: Yeah, but unless you want to refer to it as the external urethral orifice
11/05/2021, 11:10 - James: I think people know what it is
11/05/2021, 11:11 - Qck: Also the idea of Wezz now saying "no I don't think that's right" after moments ago thinking japs eye could be said aloud is laughable
11/05/2021, 11:11 - Wezz: I know you've said urethus meatus before, but surely normal people haven't
11/05/2021, 11:11 - Qck: Do you even have a cock?!
11/05/2021, 11:11 - Wezz: Tip of my urethra I guess
11/05/2021, 11:11 - Wezz: Pee hole?
11/05/2021, 11:11 - Qck: Ding ding ding
11/05/2021, 11:12 - Wezz: Im distraught tbh
11/05/2021, 11:14 - Wezz: Firstly, I thought it was all one word: japseye. Pretty sure my dad used it in a joke once when I was a wee boy. And it wasn't a punchline or anything. Oh dear.
11/05/2021, 11:14 - Wezz: By joke, I mean he used to finger my japseye
11/05/2021, 11:15 - Wezz: I'm not writing it as separate words cause then it's racist.
11/05/2021, 11:17 - James: You could spell it differently, like Gyappsaye
11/05/2021, 11:18 - Mike: Latin... Right up the with the eggnog flavour Nignog?
11/05/2021, 11:19 - Kirky: High level NHS workers for you
11/05/2021, 11:21 - Wezz: Thanks James, this is the kinda advice I was looking for.
11/05/2021, 11:22 - James: Plus when people correct you on the spelling, you could throw down the woke handbook and take the moral high ground
11/05/2021, 11:26 - Kirky: Louise had a DPD guy on the roofs behind her house yesterday, he went on a mad one and crashed his van into a shop front and went on climbed into the houses behind, police trying to get him down all day lol
11/05/2021, 11:26 - Kirky: <Media omitted>
11/05/2021, 11:26 - Kirky: Not just my office going mad
11/05/2021, 11:45 - Qck: That police officer is incredibly camouflaged
11/05/2021, 11:45 - Qck: He's a wall!
11/05/2021, 11:46 - Mike: You guys need to get those lead pipes youre clearly all drinking from removed
11/05/2021, 11:46 - Kirky: That's reading Mike sorry
11/05/2021, 11:47 - Mike: Yeh I left and look what's happened to it

11/05/2021, 12:08 - Paul: Thanks man that's all I need
11/05/2021, 12:10 - Paul: Just looking at the link I'm annoyed they spelt your wrong
11/05/2021, 12:26 - Wezz: I'll tenaciously plead ignorance until they explain in great detail why it's racist.

After which I'll proudly retort "wow I've never noticed Asians had slanty eyes"
11/05/2021, 13:40 - Kirky: <Media omitted>

11/05/2021, 13:46 - Wezz: Aw man. We had a guy who slept in the dept. He ended up jumping Infront of his ex-wifes tube one morning. Died
11/05/2021, 13:47 - Wezz: No one knew he was sleeping at work
11/05/2021, 13:47 - Wezz: He borrowed my gym card and said he lost it. Turns out he was using it to shower etc
11/05/2021, 13:54 - Kirky: No please dont make me feel bad
11/05/2021, 14:25 - Wezz: Don't worry, I used to regularly think. "What a motherfucker, who loses someone ELSE'S gym card." He showed no remorse too. Turns out he was just suicidal.
11/05/2021, 14:27 - Wezz: On that note, it's *mental health awareness week*. If any of you motherfuckers are depressed or suicidal, talk to someone. Talk to me. We can go party or cry together or something. Anytime chapsüëå

11/05/2021, 14:31 - Wezz: I'd rather help tie the noose than watch an episode of One Piece.
11/05/2021, 14:33 - Mike: @447428100241 who told us about the guy who let a guy from work sleep on his coach and then the dude started saying his baby mumma? Eventually the coacher kicked the dude out of his bed and now the dad gets lifts to work from coachman
11/05/2021, 14:33 - Mike: Seeing*
11/05/2021, 14:35 - Wezz: Coach = couch
11/05/2021, 14:35 - Mike: thank you
11/05/2021, 14:35 - Wezz: Almost had an aneurysm
11/05/2021, 14:36 - Mike: I just ate a load of turkish bread and im barely awake
11/05/2021, 14:38 - James: Yeah, it was some top tier office drama. My friend from the office is now getting involved, as he is engaged to the ex wife of the guy who was sleeping on the sofa
11/05/2021, 14:40 - Mike: I once used the mug of another guy at work, had to clean it and return it before he found out. What a day that was.
11/05/2021, 14:40 - James: So it was:
Guy A breaks up with Woman A
Guy B feels sorry for him being homeless and lets him sleep on his couch
Guy A gets with woman B, who is guy Bs girlfriend
Guy B then ends up sleeping on his own couch while looking for somewhere else to live
Guy C gets with Woman A

All three guys worked in my office at the time
11/05/2021, 14:41 - James: Oh, and Guy B had just had a surprise baby with Woman B because she "didn't know she was pregnant" until she was giving birth
11/05/2021, 14:42 - Mike: I dont even know what to do with that much drama, write a sitcom?
11/05/2021, 14:42 - Wezz: ü§®
11/05/2021, 14:42 - Wezz: Oops baby popped out
11/05/2021, 14:43 - Wezz: Are your Christmas doos just massive office orgies?
11/05/2021, 14:49 - James: She told him she had a been told by a doctor she had a stomach tumour, but there is no way someone is told about a tumour for several months without a doctor
a) realising someone fucked up the diagnosis somewhere
b) having to do a pregnancy test as a fertile young woman before any treatment
11/05/2021, 14:59 - James: Prevailing theory in the office at the time was she had cheated on him before and hid it so she could keep the baby
11/05/2021, 15:11 - Wezz: While (woman = fertile){
Do(pregnancyTest)
}
11/05/2021, 15:11 - Wezz: Literally medicine 101
11/05/2021, 15:12 - Wezz: Never stops either. All we do are pregnancy tests forever.
11/05/2021, 15:40 - James: Exactly, and you actually need to do a pregnancy test to see if you're safe to do a pregnancy test

11/05/2021, 18:47 - Wezz: _I love cakes and tits._
11/05/2021, 18:47 - Paul: Nah I'm far more of a pretentious know-it-all asshat
11/05/2021, 18:52 - Wezz: ... I hate Reddit with such passion. The sunglasses were so accurate, made it three minutes in and can't anymore.

11/05/2021, 21:37 - Wezz: Used to watch John Oliver - some great bits, then turned to incessant pandering. Americanised, some kinda white Trevor Noah.
11/05/2021, 21:38 - Paul: I like a lot of the content they talk about and they do a lot of research. Just literally the world's least interesting topic
11/05/2021, 21:52 - Wezz: Yeah, can see why his audience like him. Think the formulaic sarcastic surprised punchline and repetitive speech inflection grew old. Plus the 'us' and 'them' thing is so prevalent in talk shows in the US these days...booooring
11/05/2021, 21:59 - Paul: Yeah I just like the info on e.g. conservators and hit pieces on people I wasn't familiar with. Don't really care for the low brow humour

12/05/2021, 09:32 - Mike: He fell to the bread wars of 10/05/2021
12/05/2021, 09:41 - Paul: Oh you missed all the fun?
12/05/2021, 09:42 - Kirky: Quick did what youve failed to do for a long time
12/05/2021, 09:43 - Paul: Sex with a woman?
12/05/2021, 09:48 - Derren: Dry humour
12/05/2021, 09:49 - Noone: Sex with a woman isn't actually possible guys, I thought you'd have figured this out by now

12/05/2021, 09:49 - Derren: What about sex with a guy
12/05/2021, 09:49 - Noone: "no Ur mum gay"
12/05/2021, 09:49 - Derren: There's 2 of them in your immediate vicinity

12/05/2021, 11:14 - Wezz: You summarised the situation flawlessly.
12/05/2021, 11:25 - Piper: But who was the floor?
12/05/2021, 11:28 - James: You misunderstand, there was no floor
12/05/2021, 11:28 - James: It was floorless

12/05/2021, 12:18 - Wezz: We forgot to also update you, Dayle's now a subject in an ongoing clinical trial led by Dr Paul Fishly. Dayle's unaware of his participation and has not consented.

Primary outcome
How many days until Dayle returns to the Corona gaming team WhatsApp group?

Secondary outcomes
Will he show remorse and apologise for his previous actions?
Will he continue to post pictures of his food?
Will QCK and Dayle acknowledge each other?
What will be his reason for rejoining?
Swimming updates?
Facebook memes?
Beer fear?
12/05/2021, 12:37 - Qck: I acknowledge that Dayle's a fat mess
12/05/2021, 12:39 - Derren: Telling us that he loves us all 10/1 odds
12/05/2021, 12:39 - Qck: Think he told us that enough times after poker, also apologised a lot, also threatened me with pure unadulterated violence quite a bit
12/05/2021, 12:40 - Derren: Also constantly racist + insulting towards me followed by I love you and you're my friend
12/05/2021, 12:41 - Qck: Yeah honestly Dayle can get fucked until he sorts his own head out lmao he's a NIGHTMARE, but that's just my opinion man
12/05/2021, 12:43 - Mike: are we still talking about Dayle? This could be anyone
12/05/2021, 12:44 - Derren: üßê
12/05/2021, 12:44 - Mike: sorry kebab man I love you
12/05/2021, 12:45 - Paul: I was literally about to type this almost word for word
12/05/2021, 12:46 - Paul: Hey man tell us how you really feel
12/05/2021, 12:49 - Derren: Should I leave too, would that make you guys happier
12/05/2021, 12:49 - Mike: can you post a picnic table of food before you do?
12/05/2021, 12:49 - Mike: Feel like we should all do that till just Piper left in chat
12/05/2021, 12:50 - Qck: You can't leave until you're outside of the house Derek, so you'll be last man standing
12/05/2021, 12:50 - Paul: People of pipers known stubbornness against posting picnic tables?
12/05/2021, 12:50 - Paul: Because* wtf lol
12/05/2021, 12:51 - Qck: Shit tonguetwister
12/05/2021, 12:51 - Paul: I'm gonna be posting in this chat until well after the apocalypse just on my own
12/05/2021, 12:51 - Derren: but I went to the office yesterday
12/05/2021, 12:52 - Qck: Yeah like the UK doesn't have automated nukes that when shit finally hits the fan the Gers don't win
12/05/2021, 12:52 - Qck: You'll be dead like the rest of us traitor
12/05/2021, 12:52 - Derren: Fat slanted eyes ruler and winnie the pooh will destroy us all with nukes first anyway
12/05/2021, 12:52 - Paul: I like to think all the world's nukes are primed to go off just 1 long if statement
12/05/2021, 12:53 - Qck: Your mum's primed to go off
12/05/2021, 12:53 - Paul: Can one of the cs people tell me: if a website offers to sign in with Google or Facebook is that actually more secure? I never use it but wondered if I should
12/05/2021, 12:56 - Mike: Its generally more convenient, not really something I'd say was less secure
12/05/2021, 12:56 - James: if(war==true)
{
nuke;
}
12/05/2021, 12:56 - Derren: You'd be connecting the site to your fb or google account, why would you want that
12/05/2021, 12:56 - Mike: Providers love it because they get all your lovely account data based on the scopes you allow
12/05/2021, 12:56 - Derren: If you're using a password manager then better to make a self standing account with a random paassword
12/05/2021, 12:57 - James: It's just OAuth right, so it's just getting a token based off an existing authentication model
12/05/2021, 12:58 - Qck: Yeah, Google has no qualms with allowing any Paul, Derren and Dayle to setup a website that uses their authentication
12/05/2021, 13:00 - Mike: Strip as much personal information as you can out of your facebook and use the facebook OAuth, its more convenient and plausibly more secure Paul
12/05/2021, 13:00 - Paul: So what data am I handing over by doing this? Do we know or is it just assumed
12/05/2021, 13:00 - Qck: Just depends on if you wanna sell just your personal data to the website and trust them with your password or if you wanna sell all of your friends and family for a bit of convenience in not having to remember a new password
12/05/2021, 13:01 - Paul: Is the assumption that any site that offers that authentication does it for nefarious purposes and will sell your data?
12/05/2021, 13:01 - Mike: When you click sign in with FB you will be provided the "Scopes" of data the website provider has requested, generally name and email / dob / favourite dog breed
12/05/2021, 13:01 - Qck: I just have a dummy Facebook account for exactly this reason
12/05/2021, 13:01 - Mike: yup
12/05/2021, 13:02 - Mike: I have a facebook account for this reason
12/05/2021, 13:02 - Qck: Yeah that's what I call my personal  Facebook account
12/05/2021, 13:02 - Paul: Because he's a dummy
12/05/2021, 13:02 - Paul: Ok thanks for the info I think I'll continue to not bother using it
12/05/2021, 13:03 - Mike: Fight the good privacy fight brother
12/05/2021, 13:03 - Mike: meanwhile I'm signing up to 52k websites per second with my one click action
12/05/2021, 13:17 - James: Well, you don't trust them with your password, you're just using your Facebook password to get a random password essentially
12/05/2021, 13:17 - James: But most people are already logged into their facebook accounts on their PCs so you don't need to enter it
12/05/2021, 13:20 - Mike: I think he means if the website itself is dodgy, no matter what or where you type you are trusting them with your password. Assuming you arent already FB logged in you will have to login
12/05/2021, 13:21 - Mike: a dodgy website isnt inherently safer because it asks for your fb oauth login and vice versa
12/05/2021, 13:22 - James: Yeah, which is why sites like Steam have a warning page when navigating away from their sites, so people don't put in their steam creds to a dodgy site
12/05/2021, 13:22 - Mike: I explained that really poorly but you cant edit whatsapp, anyone want me to explain NFTs again?
12/05/2021, 13:23 - Mike: When a blockchain and a cryptocurrency love eachother in a very special grown up way
12/05/2021, 13:45 - Wezz: Literally OAuth everything useless to my Twitter account. Has all my wrong info too so can tell when I've done it, DOB is 1900. Hella convenient though.
12/05/2021, 14:46 - Wezz: Did I tell you guys? I found out that in Evelina (Children's wing of my hospital) they're using VR to have Kids walk with dinosaurs and stuff before they fall asleep to anaesthesia for procedures. Got to talk to one of the kids today, he was super excited to see the fish, literally no fear about his procedure. So cool.
12/05/2021, 14:46 - Paul: Can they do that for adults too please. I'm terrified of anaesthesia
12/05/2021, 14:48 - Kirky: thats amazing
12/05/2021, 14:48 - Kirky: so much better than the surgeon telling shit jokes
12/05/2021, 14:49 - Paul: They do something similar for MRI for kids. They have like a special green screen that turns it into a spaceship or a castle etc
12/05/2021, 14:49 - Wezz: Right?! We all said the same ! It's all cartoony stylised. Was saying not sure I'd wanna walk with real dinosaurs just before anaesthetic dreams. T-Rex about to eat me and I'm in sleep paralysis
12/05/2021, 14:50 - Mike: Wonder what this could do for immersion therapy
12/05/2021, 14:50 - Paul: I feel like it would a confusing experience to be right next to a giant T rex and then be like nah I'm gonna sleep now
12/05/2021, 14:51 - Wezz: Accidentally slip in Sharknado VR instead of the cartoon fish
12/05/2021, 14:51 - Paul: VR porn before surgery?
12/05/2021, 14:53 - Wezz: That's super cool. Adults they just had some radio station playing, had one done few months ago. Was an fMRI and they spoke to me through the headphones, so maybe was special
12/05/2021, 14:53 - Paul: I've done it a few times for experiments and it's normally just staring into the void or clicking an air pressure triggered button over and over while the sound makes you go mad
12/05/2021, 14:55 - Wezz: fMRI? That's weird. I musta had some modern one, was done in Denmark Hill. The staff there were super excited, cause they have to get in the machine once a week pretty much for testing settings. Like having a guinea pig. Plus may as well have a full-body MRI that could actually detect something helpful rather than the same students over and over.
12/05/2021, 14:56 - Wezz: I had a little mechanical clicker thing.
12/05/2021, 14:56 - Paul: Yeah they usually do both structural and functional scans for the stuff we do with experiments
12/05/2021, 14:57 - Wezz: Our fMRI work came under some pretty hard scrutiny. Some of the profs hate it
12/05/2021, 15:00 - Wezz: IIRC their argument was that it indicates increased blood flow to areas of the brain. However there's little evidence to show that equates to activation? Something like that. Currently doing them in a double-blind sham controlled device study, imaging team blinded, so may have something interesting regardless.
12/05/2021, 15:02 - Paul: They are talking about the BOLD signal. My understanding is that it's pretty indicative of activation so that's surprising
12/05/2021, 15:03 - Paul: Technically it's true that you aren't measuring neuronal activity. But it's presumed
12/05/2021, 15:03 - Paul: You'll have to send me some links to it. Sounds interesting
12/05/2021, 15:08 - Wezz: Yup! That was it. The Neuroimaging team obviously feel strongly about it's reliability.
12/05/2021, 15:15 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
12/05/2021, 16:09 - Lockers: Funny because I read this whilst supervising an after school detention
12/05/2021, 16:11 - Kirky: Haha lockers got detention
12/05/2021, 16:12 - Noone: Hehehehe
12/05/2021, 16:12 - Wezz: Do you get paid overtime for detentions?
12/05/2021, 16:12 - Wezz: What are your daily hours compared to students? @447758520258
12/05/2021, 16:15 - Lockers: Lol good one
12/05/2021, 16:16 - Lockers: In work between 7.20-7.50 depending on how busy or behind I am. Generally in work til about 5.30-6. Probably do a min of 1 hour work at home a day on top of that and weekend work fluctuates depending on how much I managed to get done during the week
12/05/2021, 16:17 - Noone: sounds like you're getting fucking scammed mate LOL
12/05/2021, 16:18 - Derren: He gets summer, Christmas, half term, full term, Easter, eid off
12/05/2021, 16:19 - Kirky: whats eid?
12/05/2021, 16:19 - Noone: >Eid
12/05/2021, 16:19 - James: Yeah, barely works half the year
12/05/2021, 16:19 - James: Google searches "Tests for kids" and has his weeks planned
12/05/2021, 16:19 - Noone: please tell me you don't get eid off
12/05/2021, 16:20 - Lockers: Dunno what he's talking about
12/05/2021, 16:20 - Lockers: Innit
12/05/2021, 16:20 - Lockers: You got me
12/05/2021, 16:21 - Wezz: I'll reiterate, I've seen Lockers open a PDF. Computer broke. Doubt he'll have much success on the Googles
12/05/2021, 16:22 - Wezz: Pretty hardcore. But how many hours _are you paid for_?
12/05/2021, 16:23 - Wezz: Turning up between 7:20 and 7:50 just tells me you're lackadaisical with your timekeeping. When are you *supposed* to turn up?
12/05/2021, 16:25 - James: Lackadaisical is a great word. 10/10 on your grammar test.
12/05/2021, 16:28 - Wezz: Thanks James, you're the best teacher in this chat ü•á

We love being able to Google all the answers to your tests too.
12/05/2021, 16:28 - Lockers: Think it's from 8.30 til 4, ain't looked at my contract in ages
12/05/2021, 16:29 - Lockers: You like to assume the worst don't you
12/05/2021, 16:29 - James: Don't mention it kid, remember, tests are just the governments way to prepare you for a job you don't want. Sing in a meadow, tell someone you love them, jump from a skyscraper, pick a bouquet of flowers!
12/05/2021, 16:29 - James: Carpe Diem students!
12/05/2021, 16:30 - Wezz: That's nuts. I thought I was bad. The rest of the teachers share that work ethic? One of you needs to draft a letter, teacher union docusign that shit and get it to HR. Bonkers.
12/05/2021, 16:31 - Wezz: Sir, I put my willy in a girl and now we have a baby. What do?
12/05/2021, 16:36 - Paul: This is normal teaching culture I've seen it slowly brainwashing Julia too
12/05/2021, 16:36 - Paul: All the others are doing it too so if you aren't doing it parents are gonna complain lol
12/05/2021, 16:37 - Paul: On the other side of the coin I think the job is infinitely more personally rewarding than anything the rest of us do
12/05/2021, 16:37 - Paul: Except me as I'm #1 teacher
12/05/2021, 16:38 - James: Seize the babe, preferably before second trimester
12/05/2021, 16:38 - Derren: We got Eid off in school in east london bro
12/05/2021, 16:38 - Derren: Go to a better school
12/05/2021, 16:38 - Derren: üòÇ
12/05/2021, 16:38 - Paul: Am I  the only person who doesn't know what Eid is
12/05/2021, 16:38 - James: Yeah, but didn't you not get a lunch break during Ramadan?
12/05/2021, 16:39 - James: Swings and Roundabouts
12/05/2021, 16:39 - Paul: Rings and Soundabouts
12/05/2021, 16:40 - Derren: why would you not get a lunch break  o.o
12/05/2021, 16:40 - Paul: Because you're at a roundabout keep up dude
12/05/2021, 16:40 - James: Because you're fasting, no lunch, no lunch break
12/05/2021, 16:40 - Derren: That's not how it works James
12/05/2021, 16:41 - James: Hey, this was the price of having Eid off
12/05/2021, 16:41 - James: Don't shoot the messenger
12/05/2021, 16:41 - Paul: Oh shit he's named you that means he's mad
12/05/2021, 16:41 - Derren: ü•±
12/05/2021, 16:41 - Paul: Dude you already killed MistoCoin give me a break
12/05/2021, 16:42 - Derren: It will make a cumback
12/05/2021, 16:46 - Lockers: What Paul said
12/05/2021, 16:46 - Lockers: Did you just assume that we're all just a bit shit? I mean, element of that too
12/05/2021, 16:57 - Noone: there was a bomb threat at the Visa office across from mine
12/05/2021, 16:57 - Noone: no explosions
12/05/2021, 17:20 - Wezz: üòÇ
12/05/2021, 17:24 - Wezz: Top joke James. Your first about seizing the unborn was a solid 7/10. But Ramadan no lunch breaks got a lol from me.
12/05/2021, 17:25 - Kirky: best joke since quicks bread swimming equation
12/05/2021, 17:25 - Noone: typical uneducated white opinions. Me and Derren have had enough, we're going to leave this chat and start a new, Muslim friendly chat with Dayle.
12/05/2021, 17:25 - Noone: I've had enough of this bigotry and IGNORANCE
12/05/2021, 17:25 - Kirky: you could open a kebab shop together with dayle as your only customer
12/05/2021, 17:25 - Kirky: youd be rich
12/05/2021, 17:26 - Noone: OH BOY OH BOY
12/05/2021, 17:27 - James: It's all for you man, you're the only person that gets my high brow humour
12/05/2021, 17:28 - Noone: James shut up we're talking about muslims
12/05/2021, 17:28 - Kirky: in the spirit of muslims can i get a #fuckisrael in chat
12/05/2021, 17:29 - Wezz: Nah I know most of you are champions and living the same _balls between a rock and a humanitarian hard place_ life that social workers do. Just assumed you'd also have that 'union' solidarity feel as teachers. And use strategy better than healthcare workers do.
12/05/2021, 17:30 - Wezz: Appreciate your hard work though mate @447758520258 üëç even if the little toerags don't
12/05/2021, 17:31 - Wezz: Eids tomorrow anyway you heathens
12/05/2021, 17:31 - Wezz: Had someone in the staff room shockingly say "How do you not know when Eid is? Thought you were Muslim?" To a coworker.
12/05/2021, 17:32 - Wezz: He didn't understand that Eid depends on lunar cycle and it was undetermined whether today or tomorrow at that point üëÄ cue awkward education
12/05/2021, 17:41 - Noone: #fuckisrael
12/05/2021, 17:56 - Lockers: Lol
12/05/2021, 18:03 - Kirky: Knew I could count on you. Not these other Zionists though
12/05/2021, 18:22 - Paul: #fuckisrael

12/05/2021, 18:29 - Alex: Just read all the teaching conversations, fuck being a real teacher! I teach adults one2one English and teach teenagers how to swear, no planning, bish bash bosh
12/05/2021, 19:24 - Wezz: üòÇ
12/05/2021, 19:28 - Wezz: Holy shit, the literal tip of the Long-COVID crisis. We have MDT clinics set up with respiratory already, lots of patients suffering post-COVID, similar to Post-Viral Fatigue or Gulf War Syndrome
12/05/2021, 19:30 - Paul: A flu pandemic is rumoured to have started the encephalitis Lethargica outbreaks that inspired Awakenings as well. Seems it has a real relevance to later developing disorders
12/05/2021, 19:31 - Kirky: Jack off while you can bois
12/05/2021, 19:32 - Derren: website doesn't work :(
12/05/2021, 19:41 - Wezz: Ooo, didn't know this. Gonna read it as it's relevant for sure, profs citing lots of fatigue syndromes.

There was a paper that linked the loss of smell/taste post-COVID to olfactory neuronal damage, unresolved in some patients. My layman brain is like; kinda makes sense. Transmission through respiratory = damage of those neurons. Know so little about it though

13/05/2021, 10:38 - James: Nice, I spent the last 15 minutes listening to classical music thanks to Paul haha
13/05/2021, 10:39 - Wezz: Well, that's one way to get Tchaikovsky spinning
13/05/2021, 10:39 - Paul: Dude that's so nostalgic to me it's actually made me emotional
13/05/2021, 10:41 - Wezz: I had an amazing version of "Just the way you are" by Billy Joel. If I could find that, it'd make me SO nostalgic. Me and my bros being idiots miming the keyboard.
13/05/2021, 10:41 - Paul: There are hundreds of them on YouTube
13/05/2021, 10:41 - Paul: I know because I spent the last hour trying to find mine

13/05/2021, 10:45 - Paul: Yeah I was gonna say that's a cool feature
13/05/2021, 10:45 - Wezz: We'd find the one that sounded most like glass in your ears and turn the volume up to max, best alarm clock. Keyboard never did catch on in our family..

13/05/2021, 11:00 - Lockers: Good Times
13/05/2021, 11:03 - James: One of my favourite annoying shitbag things I did in a music room wasn't even in a music lesson. We had an RE lesson with a sub teacher in a music room, and plugged in some headphones to the microphone port, and turned the speakers up. Everytime the teacher looked at his PC screen or turned to the whiteboard, we spoke into this shitty makeshift mic and said "Cashier number 4 please". I don't know why it was so funny, but a middle aged balding man angry about pretend checkout calls really tickled me.

13/05/2021, 11:13 - Paul: This would have been one of your early cringe Facebook posts no doubt
13/05/2021, 11:15 - James: No, because my early facebook posts are terrible, this still makes me smile
13/05/2021, 11:52 - Lockers: Dude Facebook memories are so helpful to make sure things are private and to remind yourself what a cunt you used to be

13/05/2021, 14:48 - James: Apostrophe's are dangerous
13/05/2021, 14:49 - Lockers: Is that the only way you should use it?
13/05/2021, 14:51 - James: Seeing it written so many times made me wonder where the word came from, and it's from the Greek Apo meaning from, and strephein, meaning to turn. It is a mark where a letter is turned away from where it should be.
13/05/2021, 14:52 - Paul: Apostrophe apocolpyse apropos
13/05/2021, 14:53 - James: Apo- kalupien, to uncover. Apropos is French (√° propos), no exciting Greek etymology there
13/05/2021, 14:55 - James: Interesting that Apocalypse and Revelation are often used interchangeably in a religious sense, which makes when considered it means to uncover, but it's definitely taken on new meaning due to that association.
13/05/2021, 14:56 - James: I feel like etymology is the cheat codes of history, blows my mind
13/05/2021, 14:58 - Paul: U hella gay

13/05/2021, 16:10 - Paul: Is anyone here well versed in the Israel Palestine conflict? I would love for someone to explain why it isn't pretty obvious that Palestine are the ones to support on this mess.
13/05/2021, 16:13 - Derren: Origins can be traced back to the british/us/french after ww2
13/05/2021, 16:13 - Derren: and ww1 probably too
13/05/2021, 16:13 - Derren: They carved up the old ottoman empire, drew horrible boarders, then promised an illegal state to jews (israel)
13/05/2021, 16:13 - Kirky: Anti semitic to talk bad about Israel and you dont want be anti semitic do you ?
13/05/2021, 16:14 - Derren: Caused fuck ton of wars etc and slowly over the last 70 years the israeli's have been taking more and more land from Palestine / palestinians
13/05/2021, 16:14 - Qck: Pretty sure everyone is anti-Zionist that isn't in the public eye
13/05/2021, 16:14 - Derren: So currently (and this has happened before) in areas that Israeli's want they are forcibly evicting palestians from homes that they grew up in (that their grandparents etc owned too)
13/05/2021, 16:15 - Paul: Is there a name for this event?
13/05/2021, 16:17 - Paul: Yeah I see a lot of people saying this sarcastically but I really wondered if there are any strong pro Israel arguments in this manner
13/05/2021, 16:17 - Paul: Matter*

13/05/2021, 16:30 - Mike: Also can't blame those crazy Jews, Russia gets to do it why can't they? Cheeky lil annexation is good for a country now and then

14/05/2021, 11:04 - James: It's why the two of you wingman for each other, as he's not interested in the 7 foot amazonian women
14/05/2021, 11:04 - Wezz: Professor Phillips strikes again!
14/05/2021, 11:07 - Wezz: That's weird, when I first met Mike he asked me to dress up as a 7 foot tall Amazonian woman

14/05/2021, 12:23 - Mike: Just had a beggar ask me for a loaf of bread and sandwich slices,  said I'd give her the money if I saw her spend it on that. Probably first time I've seen a beggar not refuse that.

London's beggars getting craftier or are things getting worse and they actually need food now?
14/05/2021, 12:24 - Kirky: Shes gonna sell the food and buy drugs

14/05/2021, 12:25 - James: Other homeless people
14/05/2021, 12:25 - James: It's a pyramid scheme

14/05/2021, 12:35 - Noone: Because it doesn't matter, nothing matters
14/05/2021, 12:36 - James: Finally, the nihilism I can get behind in this chat
14/05/2021, 12:36 - James: Are you an optimistic Nihilist, or a pessimistic Nihilist Jack?
14/05/2021, 12:37 - Kirky: <Media omitted>
14/05/2021, 12:40 - Wezz: Pfft you paint little figurines so they look pretty. Get out of here with your pretend Nihilism.
14/05/2021, 12:40 - Noone: My things matter though
14/05/2021, 12:40 - James: yeah, but if nothing matters then painring figures is just as important as doing anything else
14/05/2021, 12:40 - James: painting*
14/05/2021, 12:41 - Noone: They're not figures, they're ACTION FIGURES

14/05/2021, 12:44 - Wezz: Can you send us pics of your latest paint jobby Jack? Want to put something on my fridge, fill the void.
14/05/2021, 12:46 - Noone: Got a lot in the works right now, can't show you until it's done
14/05/2021, 12:47 - Noone: But hes an old man who sits on a marble throne which itself walks with robot legs
14/05/2021, 12:47 - Noone: Lots to look forward to
14/05/2021, 12:52 - James: There is a difference between nihilism as self destructive behaviour
14/05/2021, 12:56 - Wezz: If all values are baseless and nothing can be known or communicated, what is there left to do, but destroy.

14/05/2021, 13:25 - Kirky: Yea I assumed it was meant to represent a bag of food

17/05/2021, 10:59 - James: Cashing in on the Baldurs Gate 3 hype
17/05/2021, 11:02 - Derren: It's even more crazy that the 2 player option isn't even online....
17/05/2021, 11:03 - Derren: You can get Dolphin emulator and run the gamecube version @4k online with a friend

17/05/2021, 11:18 - Mike: Lol you still believe Epstein was real? He was a made up friend of prince Andrew to shift blame Moron
17/05/2021, 11:18 - Mike: Who just dies in a prison cell lmao
17/05/2021, 11:18 - Paul: Capital M moron damn he's serious
17/05/2021, 11:56 - Derren: Is that the water sprinkler or a type of detector?
17/05/2021, 11:57 - Wezz: I assume it's a smoke/gas detector. Got plumbers in fixing some stuff. Walk in and see they've stolen a glove
17/05/2021, 11:57 - James: It's a glove detector, it's been going off all morning because of some joker
17/05/2021, 11:58 - Derren: <Media omitted>
17/05/2021, 11:58 - Wezz: Sorry Mr Phillips üß§üôã‚Äç‚ôÇ
17/05/2021, 12:00 - James: Thank you Sam, what have I told you about gloves on in class. Anyway, where was I... Oh yes, Eugenics...
17/05/2021, 12:03 - Kirky: Pretty standard. I once forgot to cover a smoke detector changing those drop tiles and cleared out an entire oxford uni building üëçüëç

17/05/2021, 12:06 - Derren: I didn't realise this bitch was doing other crazy shit before
17/05/2021, 12:07 - Kirky: Who is she
17/05/2021, 12:10 - Paul: Lmao
17/05/2021, 12:10 - Derren: the one that was crying about people not having enough money to sub to her
17/05/2021, 12:10 - Derren: when it's 5$ and if you don't have 5$ you shouldn't be watching her
17/05/2021, 12:31 - Wezz: Was gonna hit it with a "lol". Was more like a ridiculous smile from me; akin to: üòÉ
17/05/2021, 12:33 - James: I have that effect on people üòè
17/05/2021, 12:42 - Paul: If it was demonstrated that raising domesticated animals vegan/vegetarian had no adverse health effects would you guys support It?
17/05/2021, 12:42 - James: More meat for me
17/05/2021, 12:43 - James: All jokes aside, yes, if it was proven beyond a doubt. It would be a lot cheaper and better for the environment
17/05/2021, 12:43 - Derren: What domesticated animals eat meat? Unless you are referring to pets
17/05/2021, 12:43 - Paul: Yeah basically pets
17/05/2021, 12:43 - Paul: Dogs cats etc
17/05/2021, 12:43 - James: Not to brag, but my guinea pigs are already vegan
17/05/2021, 12:44 - Derren: Ban pets, waste of planetary resources
17/05/2021, 12:44 - James: We should ban fun while we're at it
17/05/2021, 12:44 - Derren: Lets do it
17/05/2021, 12:44 - Derren: Where's the petition
17/05/2021, 12:45 - Paul: And if it were not proven beyond a reasonable doubt but was more akin to most dietary science, jury still technically out etc but solid theories
17/05/2021, 12:45 - Paul: Or for example if it showed they had a slightly lower quality of life but we're talking negligible. Is the ethical trade off still worth it
17/05/2021, 12:45 - Derren: Don't think it's possible to feed a dog only vegan stuff until they can make synthetic meat
17/05/2021, 12:46 - Paul: I've heard both that you definitely can and that you definitely can't lol
17/05/2021, 12:46 - Paul: Not read a lot about it
17/05/2021, 12:46 - Paul: But philosophically an interesting topic
17/05/2021, 12:47 - Wezz: Most reasonable people are gonna agree here. I'm not a pet owner, but I feel I'd feed my pet whatever they stick a Pedigree logo on if it was deemed 'safe'. Weren't there those worms that ate plastic? Feed them to my dog and we can have a go at two global concerns in one.
17/05/2021, 12:47 - Derren: Well if you're talking about ethical there isn't any question, ethically it's wrong what we humans are doing to animals, mass consumption etc
17/05/2021, 12:49 - Wezz: Ethics Schmethics - dogs love a bit of liver
17/05/2021, 12:49 - Paul: I imagine most of you would be vegetarian if it weren't for meat tasting so fucking good. I guess for pets that's less of a concern as my dog will eat literal homeless person dioreherea and fucking LOVE it
17/05/2021, 12:50 - Derren: It's not even about meat tasting good, despite other options becoming more mainstream there still isn't an amazing amount of choice when compared and from my understanding getting the same nutrients costs a lot more
17/05/2021, 12:51 - Wezz: Dude, it's totally about it tasting good. I don't stick meat on my ice cream. Cause that'd be disgusting
17/05/2021, 12:51 - Paul: It's more about convenience and effort tbh. You can be poor and still vegan easily
17/05/2021, 12:53 - Wezz: Availability plays a big role, taste the other. Nutrition is a factor that can't be argued with but I think it's a bs excuse when most of the population is using it to justify buying 4 double cheeseburgers and ¬£60 worth of Chinese
17/05/2021, 12:53 - James: I regularly have vegetarian/vegan meals, but there definitely is a lot more effort involved in producing something simple and vegan than something simple involving meat. It took 4 hours to make some vegan patties for a wrap the other day. The alternative would have been 15 minutes frying chicken.
17/05/2021, 12:53 - Derren: Vegan and being a health vegan (getting all the vitamins / nutrients you need) are 2 very different things :D
17/05/2021, 12:53 - Derren: Speak for yourself boi
17/05/2021, 12:55 - Paul: This goes for both sides though
17/05/2021, 12:55 - Derren: When I'm not at home half my meals are vege other half meat, my mum is just used to cooking with meat culturally so it's different
17/05/2021, 12:56 - Derren: Of course Paul but as I said it's more expensive doing it vegan way afaik and you need more grams of food compared to a meat diet
17/05/2021, 12:56 - James: There's definitely a cultural hangup. 90% of people grow up eating meat and knowing meals with meat
17/05/2021, 12:56 - James: It's a big learning curve to relearn those meals with substitutions
17/05/2021, 12:57 - Wezz: I have a banging go to vegetarian feta pesto pasta that takes literally no time to make. As a result I make it pretty often. Things like curry etc don't change much meat or not. But yeah, all flavour here.
17/05/2021, 12:57 - James: When I was India, half the population were vegetarian, and there wasn't worries about getting the right nutrients, they were perfectly healthy.
17/05/2021, 12:58 - James: Sounds dope, Italian cuisine lends itself to vegan as a lot of the flavours are from sauces
17/05/2021, 12:58 - Paul: As wezz said the health argument is coming from meat guzzling red necks on their 4th Chinese that week with suspected heart disease
17/05/2021, 12:59 - Paul: But I think I've gotten to the stage now where a slight health effect wouldn't impact me morally
17/05/2021, 13:00 - James: It's all a matter of perspective, a slight health impact sounds bad, but phrased as 'an express ticket off of this hell hole' sounds much better.
17/05/2021, 13:00 - Wezz: Not doing so well at the minute üëÄ
17/05/2021, 13:00 - Wezz: Few burgers will sort them out, not to worry.
17/05/2021, 13:01 - Paul: Lmao the correlation is just there libtards deal with it
17/05/2021, 13:01 - James: I suspected this would be the reply haha
17/05/2021, 13:01 - Wezz: _grilling intensifies_
17/05/2021, 13:02 - Derren: Well eating meat multiple meals a day isn't good for you either
17/05/2021, 13:02 - Derren: especially if you're eating the same type of meat multiple days in a row
17/05/2021, 13:03 - Paul: Problem with that is it's kinda condescending and also really vague. Like what does "isn't good for you" actually mean
17/05/2021, 13:03 - Derren: Your body wasn't made to eat meat as often as an average person does
17/05/2021, 13:03 - Paul: (I know all that)
17/05/2021, 13:03 - Wezz: The cultural stuff is great too, unfortunately it's a very real barrier that you're not going to change for a generation or two. I imagine to someone who's passionate about vegetarianism, it's frustrating to be met with "well it's what I've always done".

E.g. Swap the subject to Slaves, got some poor guy polishing my shoes and I'm telling you we can't abolish slavery cause I don't know how to polish my own shoes.
17/05/2021, 13:04 - Paul: I'm saying that a lot of people don't really understand what healthy food means. They think that something that has less calories makes it healthier or "diet" food is better.
17/05/2021, 13:04 - Derren: Actually eating vege products is much worse ethically than eating meat, dairy industry is probably the worst
17/05/2021, 13:05 - Paul: Well that's debatable but I know your point
17/05/2021, 13:06 - Derren: constantly impregnating cows and taking away their born and milking them constantly? :D
17/05/2021, 13:06 - Derren: Or instantly killing male chickens at birth cos useless
17/05/2021, 13:07 - Paul: Pretty sure I told you all about that like 14 years ago lol
17/05/2021, 13:07 - Derren: ü•±
17/05/2021, 13:08 - Paul: For me as someone who never bothered until recently I don't really have any issues with people who don't switch. It was only when I made the personal challenge to myself and then realised I could do it easily that I thought I had a duty to continue
17/05/2021, 13:09 - James: There are several discussions here that are often intertwined.
Moral, because we're mistreating and killing animals that aren't useful
Economic, because eating meat is much less efficient that eating crops
Environmental, because of the huge amount of emissions that the meat industry produce
One doesn't make the other a moot point, and by reducing people to vege, surely that is a step in the right direction.
17/05/2021, 13:09 - James: Very often these strategies are undermined by 'well you can change that but it doesn't fix everything so what's the point'
17/05/2021, 13:11 - Paul: Right gotta teach a class but I'll be back later to turn you all into soy boys
17/05/2021, 13:19 - Mike: Fuck your meat and veg, gimme some yummy ü™±üêõü™≤ü™∞üêúüêûü¶ãüêåü¶óü¶üü™≥üï∑Ô∏è

17/05/2021, 13:20 - Derren: Avacados are bad for south americans bruh, don't you care about what's happening to these brownies there
17/05/2021, 13:22 - Qck: central america and the caribbean
17/05/2021, 13:22 - Derren: Same thing init
17/05/2021, 13:22 - Qck: ok racist
17/05/2021, 13:37 - Derren: Only white people are racist
17/05/2021, 14:13 - Wezz: I think if we're throwing taste to the wayside we should go this route for sure. I also believe if we scrap the slaughterhouse industry we'd have a lot more mass murderers on the loose. Swings and roundabouts.
17/05/2021, 14:16 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
17/05/2021, 14:18 - Wezz: Next we'll be "making way" for a worm on the M25.
17/05/2021, 14:19 - Mike: I think if we put our individual selves on the sliding scale of dominance we'd be roughly above small dogs, hence your inability to not chew through a wooden fork
17/05/2021, 14:20 - Mike: Praise be to those farmers who break their backs so I'm not mauled by a boar
17/05/2021, 14:27 - Wezz: I think you're vastly underestimating our ability to sell goods and services for weapons. Just look at Israel and the US for tips.
17/05/2021, 15:16 - Paul: Kirky makes delicious brownies
17/05/2021, 15:18 - James: What have we talked about when it comes to fetishising Kirky, Paul?
17/05/2021, 15:23 - Paul: Do it often and loudly?
17/05/2021, 15:41 - Lee: Haven't read all the chat. But I haven't eaten meat since 2016 and haven't had a sick day for almost three years. Not sure if related.
17/05/2021, 15:41 - James: <Media omitted>
17/05/2021, 15:42 - James: Congrats! Do you mind if I ask what prompted the change?
17/05/2021, 15:44 - Noone: haha big gay boy
17/05/2021, 15:49 - Lee: My ex was vegan and I lived with her. She was really good about it actually, and I continued to eat meat at first. But then she slowly brainwashed me and made me watch a bunch of shit that I couldn't ever un-watch. Then I made the jump.
17/05/2021, 15:49 - Lee: So yeah, CUZ OF GRIL
17/05/2021, 15:51 - Mike: You may not have been sick but I've seen you in person, would not recommend
17/05/2021, 15:51 - Lee: Loool. True blue.
17/05/2021, 15:52 - Nathan: I eat meat probably everyday and not had a sick day in like 6 years
17/05/2021, 15:54 - Lockers: I eat meat regularly and feel awful right now, but I think that might be more to do with the copious amounts of alcohol I drank over the weekend
17/05/2021, 15:54 - Lee: I used to have colds and sore throats all the time. Then it just stopped. Like I say, could just be coincidence, could be anything.
17/05/2021, 15:56 - Kirky: I've had meat twice today and feel great
17/05/2021, 15:59 - Noone: I've both never eaten meat, and am constantly eating meat at all times
17/05/2021, 15:59 - Wezz: I brush my teeth with meat and my dicks being growing uncontrollably
17/05/2021, 16:07 - James: Out of context it sounds like you're saying giving someone head makes you hard.
17/05/2021, 16:07 - James: I mean it sounds like that in context too
17/05/2021, 16:13 - Paul: We get it you go to uni

19/05/2021, 09:35 - James: I think you can mark a stream as intended for mature audiences, but I don't think there is age verification
19/05/2021, 09:43 - Derren: Do you have to be of a certain age to Watch gambling?
19/05/2021, 09:46 - James: Well, you don't need to be a certain age to watch anything physically, but it's the moral implication to promoting gambling to developing minds that don't understand the losses it can bring about. You can't gamble in video games in a game rated less than a 12, so it stands to reason that there would be a age restriction in place for watching real gambling.
19/05/2021, 09:49 - Derren: These people don't give a shit about others, they act and play dumb and make fuck tons of money from it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
19/05/2021, 09:50 - Paul: I don't think it's the streamers responsibility at all. It's on twitch
19/05/2021, 09:52 - Mike: Yup
19/05/2021, 09:52 - Mike: But twitches gambling & hot tub streams make money printers go brrrrrrr
19/05/2021, 10:06 - James: Yeah, I agree, Twitch are very lazy when it comes to their content control, I was just saying what was there already
19/05/2021, 10:09 - Paul: I think if a kid is being strongly influenced by a twitch streamer into gambling then that's also on the parents
19/05/2021, 10:10 - James: Yeah, but parent's can't always be present/trusted, else there wouldn't be a need for ratings at all
19/05/2021, 10:10 - Paul: I meant more generally not raising their kid to be a retard
19/05/2021, 10:11 - Paul: And I don't think I really support ratings anyway. Seems lazy to me
19/05/2021, 10:11 - James: Yeah, but that's just not how the world works, it's not stupidity to be influenced
19/05/2021, 10:12 - James: It's a massive oversimplification to say 'people should just know better than making mistakes'
19/05/2021, 10:13 - Paul: No doubt but generally speaking if you've done any semblance of worthwhile job raising your kid they aren't gonna be stealing your credit card to gamble on fortnite skins because ninja was doing it
19/05/2021, 10:14 - Paul: Plus making the mistake is fine. That's where the parent can do the best job to teach them
19/05/2021, 10:14 - James: Are you the scarecrow? Your strawman is showing
19/05/2021, 10:16 - Paul: I dunno man I just don't buy in to ratings as a helpful system. It's just a lazy way to ignore critical thinking lessons and teaching about context. Obviously I was being facetious with the ninja example
19/05/2021, 10:17 - James: I agree, in a perfect world, however there are a lot of people that don't have the structure or support to live in the 'mistake=lesson' world.
19/05/2021, 10:18 - Paul: True. I'm aware that I'm missing some nuance and fringe cases with that opinion
19/05/2021, 10:19 - Mike: https://youtu.be/3jFqhjaGh30

19/05/2021, 13:36 - Wezz: 0.5% is considered alcohol free? ü§î I remember being able to buy shandy super young, that was 0.x%
19/05/2021, 13:37 - Mike: 0.05% is alcohol free, think someone fucked up the tag here
19/05/2021, 13:53 - Paul: The alcohol free tag or the alcohol percentage
19/05/2021, 13:53 - Paul: Either way I can think of a lawsuit for either case. Buy a ton you'll be rich
19/05/2021, 13:54 - Mike: The free tag, the percentage is correct
19/05/2021, 13:55 - Paul: Perfect. Time to operate some heavy machinery
19/05/2021, 13:55 - Mike: No idea how many cans you'd need to drink to feel something at 0.5 abv

19/05/2021, 15:07 - Paul: Hey aren't you the guy taking painkillers before work?
19/05/2021, 15:07 - Kirky: Cause I drink half a bottle of a vodka the night before
19/05/2021, 15:08 - Paul: Yeah exactly m8
19/05/2021, 15:28 - Derren: Sounds like you got a problem
19/05/2021, 15:36 - James: His problem is he can't manage the other half before falling asleep
19/05/2021, 15:49 - Kirky: James gets it
19/05/2021, 15:52 - Paul: I just drank a 5th of vodka, dare me to drive?
19/05/2021, 16:20 - Derren: regularly drink more than the maximum recommended amount of alcohol (14 units a week)
19/05/2021, 16:20 - Derren: ü§î
19/05/2021, 16:21 - Kirky: whats that?
19/05/2021, 16:24 - Derren: I was just reading about a pain killer I'm taking and it said don't take if you have or do blah blah
19/05/2021, 16:24 - Kirky: oh ok
19/05/2021, 16:25 - Derren: And this was on the list, it's just funny that it says maximum amount of alcohol a week is 14 units
19/05/2021, 16:25 - Kirky: only 7 double shots
19/05/2021, 16:28 - Derren: I'm sure you guys do more than that on the weekend üòÇ
19/05/2021, 16:28 - Derren: Isn't that what kirky does every night before work

19/05/2021, 16:37 - Kirky: i actually dont have any alchohol left
19/05/2021, 16:38 - James: Shut up bitch! I'm tryin' to talk! Hey Slim, that's Drew screamin' in the trunk
19/05/2021, 17:05 - Paul: But I didn't slit his throat I just tied him up see I ain't like you. Because then if he suffocated he'll suffer more and then he'll die too. Well gotta go almost at the drew now. Oh shit I forgot how am I meant to send this drew out?
19/05/2021, 17:06 - Paul: Soffocates I literally corrected that twice and it still changed fml
19/05/2021, 17:07 - Paul: Fucking suffocates

You were the countries new Jeremy Kyle. Except everyone loved you and heeded your word, like some kinda modern prophet.

Maybe give that a go in your spare time. Felt disturbingly real
19/05/2021, 21:45 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
19/05/2021, 21:45 - Derren: Are you suggesting that everybody hates Jeremy Kyle?
19/05/2021, 21:46 - James: Interesting, I've been told a few times while playing DnD that I would make a great cult leader, this might be the final sign to take the leap. Anyone for flavor-aid?

19/05/2021, 21:53 - Derren: And the low tier scum humans that go on the show love it too
19/05/2021, 21:54 - Paul: No one watches that show for him lol. They watch it to feel better about themselves while people humiliate their friends and family for 5 minutes of t.v. fame
19/05/2021, 21:55 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
19/05/2021, 21:57 - Paul: Oh no he's gonna make me do a polygraph and prove I secretly like him in front of everyone and I'll agree to it despite knowing I'm lying for some reason
19/05/2021, 21:57 - Wezz: He'll pay you though, so there's that?
19/05/2021, 21:57 - Paul: He's a shitter version of judge judy she's fun
19/05/2021, 21:59 - Wezz: Can't we eat them all?
19/05/2021, 22:00 - Paul: Well naturally id love to but James put an age rating on that so I'm now allowed

But Jeremy Kyle gave us the best clip in tabloid talk show history ^ ^
19/05/2021, 22:03 - Paul: God the self satisfied smugness of him. God I hate that weasely fuck
19/05/2021, 22:04 - Paul: I'd throw it at him too
19/05/2021, 22:04 - Lockers: You'd miss. Never got a head shot

19/05/2021, 22:08 - Lockers: You forgot the part where you fall down the stairs and start crying

21/05/2021, 14:19 - Qck: dude got into doge late and then started getting upset that people who were there from ground zero had all the coins
21/05/2021, 14:21 - Mike: Yeh it's some account that's been active for years
21/05/2021, 14:28 - Wezz: Similar with BTC, someone moved money from the original BTC wallet at one point and the whole market went into a downward spin. Don't think it was anywhere as high as 30% though.
21/05/2021, 14:29 - Wezz: Some believe it was Satoshi himself.
21/05/2021, 14:30 - Wezz: Feel like I'm telling a folktale..

22/05/2021, 13:22 - Kirky: I'm still a little drunk I think and I've got to start drinking again at 3

A collective noun needs to be singular, otherwise you may as well use the plural of the original word, and even if we're ignoring the point of collective nouns, she should say 'a group of sexists ARE called gamers'.

25/05/2021, 11:23 - Mike: What flavour
25/05/2021, 11:53 - Lee: Important question
25/05/2021, 11:54 - Mike: Bet it wasn't doner kebab

25/05/2021, 12:00 - Wezz: Got a mini lol from me that

25/05/2021, 13:05 - Alex: Sour cream and onion to the grave
25/05/2021, 13:18 - Wezz: Important clarification, the Pringles can was actually normal size.

He was cremated and some of his remains went in the normal sized Pringles can.

God I'm dumb
25/05/2021, 13:19 - Wezz: Just assumed it was some gigantic custom made can ü•∏

25/05/2021, 18:39 - Paul: More of a correction than a clarification, just to clarify.
25/05/2021, 18:39 - Paul: I too was imagining a giant custom Pringles can and you've ruined my dreams
25/05/2021, 18:40 - Wezz: Not to worry, you can still imagine one. Don't let facts get in the way.
25/05/2021, 18:41 - Paul: No I can't. The second you said it was a normal one I was unable to see it. Magic was gone

25/05/2021, 19:36 - Wezz: Weird bit of zac with his passive... cool though.

26/05/2021, 09:40 - Derren: $50 spins gawd damn
26/05/2021, 09:48 - Wezz: And so it begins. Twitch slots gonna take off like crazy
26/05/2021, 09:48 - Wezz: Xqc GTA ban so he's gonna slot, Buddha, Greek, all the existing streamers too.
26/05/2021, 09:49 - Mike: Perfect environment for it, clips of the billion dollar wins outshadowing the 4 hours of boredom
26/05/2021, 09:50 - Wezz: Yup. And casinos rubbing their hands together dishing out tonnes of big free bonuses to the streamers to ensure the clips exist.
26/05/2021, 09:51 - Mike: Special accounts with different odds you think?
26/05/2021, 09:51 - Wezz: Naw, literally we'll give you ¬£50k a week in ¬£10k increments. You keep any winnings but must play for over X hours.
26/05/2021, 09:52 - Mike: Some steamers were doing this with their own gambling sites right?
26/05/2021, 09:52 - Wezz: If they changed odds would lose licenses and go to jail. But they can give free money.
26/05/2021, 09:52 - Mike: Or related to them sites, think csgo too
26/05/2021, 09:52 - Wezz: Yeah that was some csgo skins sites and dodgy rubbish.
26/05/2021, 09:53 - Wezz: Owner literally had a button he could press to guarantee a win.
26/05/2021, 09:53 - James: Yeah, its almost definitely going to be We give you X amount, and you spend at least Y on a stream
26/05/2021, 09:54 - Wezz: Yeah, these are licensed casinos.
26/05/2021, 09:55 - Wezz: Can avoid all that by just giving free balance. Doubt it's even got a playthrough on it since would flag to the viewers it's all promo. Instead a verbal agreement that they play a lot before cashing.
26/05/2021, 09:56 - Derren: What's the difference between a game company paying a streaming 10-100k an hour to play their new game and a casino giving free credit to somebody
26/05/2021, 09:56 - Derren: It's the same shit
26/05/2021, 09:56 - Wezz: Any issues, e.g. not enough playtime, they talk behind the scenes and resolve.
26/05/2021, 09:56 - Derren: https://www.twitch.tv/xqcow

26/05/2021, 09:57 - Derren: qxc with 100k+ viewers watching him play slots jesus
26/05/2021, 09:57 - Lee: Finally became mainstream.

26/05/2021, 09:58 - Derren: <Media omitted>
26/05/2021, 09:59 - Wezz: Not a lot from the company perspective.

But in reality Influences a tonne of young adults to gamble. Portion of those will get addicted.
26/05/2021, 10:07 - Wezz: Never really understood why companies give such large balances. Surely less relatable, I guess more immediate headlines for wins. But if you wanna influence the many, you wanna go somewhere more feasible like ~¬£1k surely.
26/05/2021, 10:07 - Piper: but did they play napoleon?
26/05/2021, 10:08 - Derren: If people are so gullible to gamble cos they see streamers doing it then surely showing larger balance is better cos it will make them want to win that much too
26/05/2021, 10:10 - Wezz: I guess. Xqc streams to low IQ kids tbh. Bet average age is 16 or so.
26/05/2021, 10:10 - James: Yeah, people don't think about throwing $50 away with each spin, they see someone win $300K and think about what they could use that money for
26/05/2021, 10:11 - Mike: Love how the streamers have become the hosts of shit casino games you see in sky bet live
26/05/2021, 10:12 - Mike: "Welcome MrListerTheSister..."
26/05/2021, 10:12 - James: I wonder who makes more money, some woman in a tight dress in front of a green screen on Sky bankroll, or a streamer?
26/05/2021, 10:13 - Mike: Hot tub gambling streams when?
26/05/2021, 10:14 - Wezz: Those skybet hosts need to entrepreneur it up. Hot tub at home, twitch stream in a bikini presenting live slots. Easy money.
26/05/2021, 10:14 - James: I smell a gap in the market Mike
26/05/2021, 10:14 - Wezz: Plus most of them are smoking hot.
26/05/2021, 10:15 - James: So is Mike, what are you saying Wezz?
26/05/2021, 10:15 - Mike: Big papa Wezz needs to buy me a hot tub
26/05/2021, 10:16 - Mike: I'll say any names for a tip, welcome IDeepThroatHorses, have a lucky time!
26/05/2021, 10:16 - James: You heard him Sam, get the man his tub
26/05/2021, 10:18 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
26/05/2021, 10:20 - James: Oh damn, 'splashing' the cash, pun intended
26/05/2021, 10:22 - Wezz: These lambos aren't gonna pay for themselves, get to work thot!

Encourage those kids to gamble!
26/05/2021, 10:25 - Derren: <Media omitted>
26/05/2021, 10:26 - Derren: all 3 of you can get in mike
26/05/2021, 10:26 - Derren: Full house stream
26/05/2021, 10:27 - Wezz: Serious question, those girls who host Sky live bet. How much do they make an hour?
26/05/2021, 10:28 - Wezz: I feel we could set this up on a shoe string, have 5 booths going in my flat
26/05/2021, 10:29 - Mike: My new twitch channel will be me and Piper interviewing random guests with deeply personal questions whilst in a hot tub. Every 5 minutes, Piper sums up his thoughts on the conversation so far. A Slot machine spins in the background with 1000 pound in it, once it reaches 0 the interview ends.

If a bonus arrives, all hot tubees must dance to Cool for the Summer on repeat until bonus end.
26/05/2021, 10:29 - Mike: Do you know 5 hotties?
26/05/2021, 10:30 - Wezz: You have three in your household already
26/05/2021, 10:31 - Mike: Wow I know you fancy Pedro but no need to do Jack dirty like that
26/05/2021, 10:31 - Wezz: We need some international appeal man, can't just have you three pasty boys in a hot tub in the kitchen
26/05/2021, 10:34 - Noone: <Media omitted>
26/05/2021, 10:41 - Qck: bring your degu to work day?
26/05/2021, 10:44 - James: üíï
26/05/2021, 10:45 - Noone: He's a handsome little man
26/05/2021, 10:45 - Qck: feel like multimillionaire streamers gambling big chunks is probably gonna result in legislation that clamps down on that sort of thing

I thought male streamers were shrewd with revealing how wealthy they are, like female streamers when they have a boyfriend

feel like big dicking on a roulette table isn't gonna result in as many donations? fuck do I know though, let the kids gamble
26/05/2021, 10:46 - Qck: that's an eat your face whilst you sleep dog, get outta here
26/05/2021, 10:50 - Paul: mOE got chat logs leaked where he was talking on Skype to the owner of a skin gambling site and manipulating the roll odds in real time while streaming it. It was pretty big drama at the time but nothing ever happened afaik
26/05/2021, 10:50 - James: Yeah, but I think money speaks more to the boomers making the law than some video game skins
26/05/2021, 10:50 - James: Even when they are worth thousands
26/05/2021, 10:56 - Noone: Expecting anything other than a scam when you gamble on an unregulated gambling site means you're a retard and you deserve to lose your money. Good on Moe for taking money away from spastics
26/05/2021, 10:57 - James: Yeah, but how does some 14 year old who watches streamers know anything about gambling regulations and authoritative bodies?
26/05/2021, 10:58 - Derren: How does a 14 year old have access to all this money is my question
26/05/2021, 10:58 - Noone: They don't, that's why as a parent you don't give your kid access to your credit card
26/05/2021, 10:59 - Noone: I hope csgo gambling takes off even more, more and more people getting scammed means the nature of random rewards for cash in games will be scrutinised more heavily
26/05/2021, 10:59 - Noone: Hopefully then people will be less willing to give their money to RNG loot boxes in actual games
26/05/2021, 10:59 - Derren: even when I was 14 I was working my mum taught me to save my money and not gamble it away :|
26/05/2021, 11:00 - Noone: Moe and all the other sly cunts who did that gambling site a while back are inadvertently helping gaming, I might invest
26/05/2021, 11:00 - Qck: poor little brown boy
26/05/2021, 11:01 - Wezz: they were misrepresenting odds etc, people would put skins in and be given x% to win the pot (all other users skins). Then he'd tell admin to force the result to him. It's like stealing pokemon cards from pre teens.
26/05/2021, 11:04 - Paul: If those Pokemon cards were worth hundreds
26/05/2021, 11:05 - Qck: don't make me read about Derek having to share his cards with his cousin again as it'll tip me over the edge
26/05/2021, 11:06 - Qck: you hear that Derek? I don't want any of you or your cousin's shit
26/05/2021, 11:08 - Noone: This is exactly what all these little dickheads have to learn. Don't trust everyone in the media, don't trust websites that promise you big gains
26/05/2021, 11:14 - Qck: this is why I market steroids to black bodybuilders online but it's actually just some AIDS blood in a syringe
26/05/2021, 11:16 - Paul: Hmm I dunno man it's pretty fucked up. I would agree with you if he were just gambling normally, then it's their own fault. But what he was doing was pretty fucked up and fraudulent
26/05/2021, 11:30 - Mike: Jack's salty because of my big crypto gambling gains
26/05/2021, 11:30 - Mike: To the üåö
26/05/2021, 11:40 - Wezz: Although I laughed at your previous jokes. I've also donated to charity to relieve the guilt.
26/05/2021, 11:42 - Qck: glad someone's laughing and I've not just made Derek sad about the 50% of the Charizard he owns but never sees
26/05/2021, 11:48 - James: Jesus, I'm talking to one of the QAs in India. Not only is his area fucked by Covid, also:
- He is in the middle of an 85 mph cyclone
- The sea has come inland by 6 km
- Areas have been evacuated because of it with loads of families cramped in evacuation centres
- A crocodile park has been hit by the cyclone, and crocodiles have escaped into the river system
26/05/2021, 11:49 - James: It's like 2012 over there
26/05/2021, 11:49 - James: (The film, not the year)
26/05/2021, 11:59 - Wezz: Woah, I'd imagine my QA standards would drop significantly in a global disaster.

"Fuck it, that code seems okay." whilst frantically scooping water out of my livingroom into the crocodile cyclone.
26/05/2021, 12:00 - Derren: I have a charizard in my wardrobe
26/05/2021, 12:28 - Qck: in your fucking dreams do you get out of here
26/05/2021, 12:29 - Derren: <Media omitted>
26/05/2021, 12:29 - Derren: What about my KANGASKHAN
26/05/2021, 12:29 - Qck: also why do crocodile parks exist? are people really like: lets go to the park but specifically the park infested with crocodiles
26/05/2021, 12:30 - Qck: why is it 7pm where you are? that's not a Charizard! what sort of bullshit are you trying to pull here Derek?!
26/05/2021, 12:30 - Derren: old pic
26/05/2021, 12:30 - Derren: I cba to pull out the cards now
26/05/2021, 12:31 - Qck: because your cousin has them, case dismissed
26/05/2021, 12:31 - Piper: i had a zapdos
26/05/2021, 12:31 - Piper: that was my favourite
26/05/2021, 12:32 - Qck: I don't think a pokemon can own another pokemon
26/05/2021, 12:33 - Derren: Same, shame it's the worst legendary bird
26/05/2021, 12:33 - Piper: im a pokeman not mon
26/05/2021, 12:33 - Kirky: Theres one near me. I think it was just some dude wanted them as pets but you cant ? So he made a park instead
26/05/2021, 12:34 - Qck: forgot you had the surgery!
26/05/2021, 12:34 - Qck: lmao i imagine that's how all these things start
26/05/2021, 12:34 - James: They're not dog walking parks, they're like sanctuaries, like conservation zoos
26/05/2021, 12:35 - Qck: oh yes let's build a sanctuary for the lovely crocodiles

its pc gone mad
26/05/2021, 12:37 - James: Without these sanctuaries, they'd be extinct in a while
26/05/2021, 12:38 - James: Alligators would be next, we'd see them gone later
26/05/2021, 12:42 - Qck: <Media omitted>

26/05/2021, 12:56 - James: What the fuck did I just watch
26/05/2021, 12:56 - Derren: A piece of internet history
26/05/2021, 12:57 - Qck: a vintage maymay that was appropriated from a freestyle by chip the ripper (kid cudi's collaborator)
26/05/2021, 13:00 - Paul: Same man it briefly made me popular
26/05/2021, 13:00 - Paul: God is definitely punishing them for something. Maybe being too homophobic? Or maybe too gay? One of those
26/05/2021, 13:17 - Qck: welp seems like the only way to solve it is a lot of gay indian sex with anti-gay rhetoric omitted during coitus
26/05/2021, 13:19 - Qck: and if that doesn't work the exact opposite
26/05/2021, 13:25 - Paul: a massive gay lynching with pro-gay rhetoric?
26/05/2021, 13:27 - Qck: feed the gays to the crocs
26/05/2021, 13:27 - Derren: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF5qXS7S6qA
26/05/2021, 13:27 - Paul: or the opposite maybe?
26/05/2021, 13:28 - Qck: croc the gays to the feed?
26/05/2021, 13:37 - Paul: You had my curiosity, now you have my attention
26/05/2021, 15:34 - Kirky: Just had a cold call telemarketer phone me, asked how I was, asked him in return how he was. He thanked me for being polite and the first person to not be rude to him all day ü•∫ü•∫
26/05/2021, 15:34 - Kirky: Ofc as soon as he said he was calling for some survey I just hung up ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
26/05/2021, 15:35 - Kirky: But for those few seconds I guess I made this covid ridden Indians day
26/05/2021, 16:00 - Mike: My friend used to be a cold caller for a CRM company, fuck me he looked soul destroyed every day
26/05/2021, 16:25 - Paul: I worked the phones at a car insurance company dealing with sales and complaints and people are absolute cunts when they can't see you. It's actually the worst job ever. And that's people who called me on purpose. Can't even imagine having to be a cold caller. Feel awful for them
26/05/2021, 16:26 - Paul: Since then I'm always friendly to people on the phone
26/05/2021, 16:26 - Paul: Even if they suck at it
26/05/2021, 16:27 - James: I'm friendly, but also hangup for cold callers, I know it's their job but should I really spend '20 seconds' which turns into 5 minutes answering bullshit questions so they can sell my data?
26/05/2021, 16:29 - Qck: still didn't influence how you reacted to people playing poorly in cunter strike
26/05/2021, 16:30 - Paul: Oh for sure I'm not doing their shitty survey but I try to remind myself that the guy on the phone doesn't give 2 shits about that product and just needs a job
26/05/2021, 16:31 - Paul: Nah just on the phone I'm a dick everywhere else including via text also fuck u bitch
26/05/2021, 16:32 - Wezz: Wonder how cold callers would treat someone cold calling them?
26/05/2021, 16:32 - Paul: I feel like I've heard radio shows do this
26/05/2021, 16:38 - Wezz: Ah fuck, stealing from radio skits again...feeling a lot like @447735640402
26/05/2021, 16:38 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
26/05/2021, 16:44 - Noone: The smiles of a couple morons

26/05/2021, 16:48 - Wezz: Eyeballs too white 6/10
26/05/2021, 16:57 - Kirky: Seinfeld did a scene on this
26/05/2021, 16:57 - Kirky: https://youtu.be/QRh1CMC3OVw
26/05/2021, 16:57 - Kirky: Similar anyway
26/05/2021, 17:01 - Paul: Actually I think the radio version was getting pizza places to phone each other
26/05/2021, 17:14 - James: Dunkey did that as well
26/05/2021, 20:00 - Paul: Anyone read ready player one?
26/05/2021, 20:07 - James: Yeah, how come?
26/05/2021, 20:20 - Paul: Heard it's good and wanted to give it a try
26/05/2021, 20:20 - James: Yeah, the book is better than the film
26/05/2021, 20:20 - James: Classic clich√©
26/05/2021, 20:23 - Paul: Haven't seen the film and heard it was shit
26/05/2021, 20:23 - Paul: But it was recommended as a book for people who liked enders game and I loved that
26/05/2021, 20:24 - Qck: watched it on an airplane, it was okay
26/05/2021, 20:25 - Qck: although wouldn't recommend unless you're on a plane and haven't got anything else to do for 2 hours
26/05/2021, 20:25 - Qck: "read" dune
26/05/2021, 20:25 - Paul: Well I'm on a train for 7 hours tomorrow
26/05/2021, 20:25 - Paul: Already have

26/05/2021, 20:26 - Qck: the spice flows through your ass
26/05/2021, 20:26 - Paul: I've downloaded ready player one already
26/05/2021, 20:26 - Paul: Well the main character is called Paul so it's gotta be done
26/05/2021, 20:27 - Qck: <Media omitted>
26/05/2021, 21:28 - James: The film is fine, it's a bit flashy and feels a bit like an advert at times
26/05/2021, 21:34 - Wezz: Yeah, I thought it was alright. Some cool visuals and the environment was interesting and immersive, but nothing that stuck with me after watching tbh.
26/05/2021, 22:13 - Alex: I started it, but couldn't get through it, and I was stuck on a plane when I tried it!
26/05/2021, 22:16 - Wezz: Did you walk out?
26/05/2021, 22:17 - Alex: Emergency exit row, just opened up the door, went straight out 10/10 would recommend

27/05/2021, 00:25 - Wezz: This is what they do to Mike at the clubs.
27/05/2021, 00:26 - Derren: I love how he's just getting sprayed and it doesn't even phase him
27/05/2021, 00:26 - Derren: And he says stop but doesn't even put his hand out or anything

27/05/2021, 08:48 - Mike: That first dude is a woman?
27/05/2021, 08:55 - Derren: That's racist

27/05/2021, 18:31 - Lockers: Where is this?
27/05/2021, 18:32 - Paul: Haha man it's actually identical. I wanted to chuck my HE across as I spawned
27/05/2021, 18:32 - Paul: Venice
27/05/2021, 18:32 - Lockers: Fuck you and your ability to travel. Looks lovely
27/05/2021, 18:33 - Paul: We had to do about a billion covid tests and then no one even looked at them?
27/05/2021, 18:37 - Lockers: Box ticking
27/05/2021, 18:41 - Noone: Julia was having a great time until you started explaining what 2v2 csgo was and how this bridge is important
27/05/2021, 18:44 - Paul: Pretty much went exactly like this
27/05/2021, 19:00 - Kirky: Did you tell her that's the sole reason for the visit?
27/05/2021, 19:11 - Noone: Julia you won't believe it, but there's another csgo landmark in the next city we're visiting! Isn't that crazy? Julia?
27/05/2021, 19:12 - Qck: paul arriving at the airport:

wait this isn't cs_italy
27/05/2021, 19:22 - Noone: Julia turns to face Paul, the grief on her face is masked just barely by the half smile she offers him in return. She appears to age as Paul looks at her face as it was, 60 years ago. The bridge he's standing on comes up to meet him as he realises he's not standing at all. He's lying perched up in a large bed, but it's not his own. The sounds and smells of Venice give way to the slow ticking of the clock on the wall, a sterile and quiet room enters his vision as he draws a pained, deep breath.
"It... it's the bridge from Counter-strike Source... no, Counter strike offensive?.. no that's not right" he says in a raspy voice, stumbling over his words as his failing memory taunts him
Julia comforts him with a hand placed atop his trembling fingers. He still recognises the comforts from his long life.
"yes, Counter-Strike... I think I'll play some with the guys tomorrow...Shots in chat"
He rests his head back comfortably on the big pillow left to him by his grandchildren.
"yes, another game of Counter-Strike".
The old man closes his eyes and falls asleep. The beeping of  the heart monitor grows to a continuous tone.
27/05/2021, 19:24 - Lockers: get a job
27/05/2021, 19:29 - Paul: The grief on her face is masked just barely by her FFP2 face mask
27/05/2021, 19:42 - Paul: Jack we've got a bidet in out hotel. Thoughts?
27/05/2021, 19:42 - Noone: I think it's great that biden is in your hotel, I'm glad he's getting out and seeing the world
27/05/2021, 19:52 - James: What are you bidding on in Venice?
27/05/2021, 19:53 - Qck: a couple of old biddies in your hotel? sounds like venice

27/05/2021, 20:16 - Qck: if you want a review on the head hunter script - it's not good!

27/05/2021, 20:21 - James: The line 'Siri, order UberLux' was never going to be in a masterpiece

27/05/2021, 20:28 - Paul: Check out Tarantino over here
27/05/2021, 20:33 - Qck: well submit it to the blacklist and you too might win best script of 2020 (this won that)

27/05/2021, 20:47 - James: This was my characters perspective of the campaigns recent events, and partly played into the propaganda of him vying for power in this new city
27/05/2021, 20:48 - James: I wrote it in a hyperfocus 6 hour session where I realized at the end I'd spent a Saturday on a joke
27/05/2021, 20:51 - Qck: yeah the head hunter didn't have any moments which made me laugh out loud whereas this line in your script:

"...probably won‚Äôt share your ‚Äòwater‚Äô because it‚Äôs really blood,
you carnivores (coughs and bends over)"

gives me a massive raging hard-on for this sickly man
27/05/2021, 20:51 - Qck: can you extrapolate on how he bent over, was he built like a dump truck from behind? I need deets
27/05/2021, 20:52 - James: He made accusation as he was talking to lizardmen, who have the reputation of being people eaters
27/05/2021, 20:54 - Qck: no I'm asking you about him bending over in particular
27/05/2021, 21:25 - Noone: it's so weird that you mention the Bidet, I literally told this story to one of the guys at work today
27/05/2021, 21:26 - Noone: told him how the smartest guy I know once took a shit in a bidet thinking it was a toilet
27/05/2021, 21:27 - Noone: "hey Ed, your little toilet won't flush"
27/05/2021, 21:29 - Mike: I love that this story is permeating society
27/05/2021, 21:29 - Mike: Can't wait to use it in my best man speech
27/05/2021, 21:32 - Kirky: Misto has a higher IQ and works at McDonald's
27/05/2021, 21:33 - Noone: Misto has the highest IQ of any of the lower primates (Turks)
27/05/2021, 22:07 - Derren: I have a bidet in my house, should I send him a video guide on how to use it?

31/05/2021, 09:49 - Paul: On the way back we needed to do a rapid antigen test at the red cross. We thought it would be easy peasy. So we showed up at 12. There was a line of like 200 people. We got in the queue and about 5 minutes later a worker came over and said no more after you 2. We were literally the last people allowed to be tested before they had to close. In this giant queue. Luckiest thing ever.
31/05/2021, 11:24 - James: Fuck man, that's crazy lucky. Would you have had to stay there another day if you couldn't do it?
31/05/2021, 11:48 - Wezz: I heard they'd make you join East 17 üò≥
31/05/2021, 11:49 - Paul: So we could have risked it with a pharmacy rapid test as they don't check everyone. But you'd be in quite a lot of trouble I think
31/05/2021, 13:39 - Qck: uh oh a lot of trouble?!

02/06/2021, 11:06 - Paul: Welcome back to another exciting instalment of CORONA GAMING CELEBRITY DEATHMATCH

Boy, do we have a treat for you today. A much anticipated match-up that's guaranteed to get the crowd talking!
Before we introduce the competitors, its good to get a quick reminder of the rules of engagement: rule number 1. You can only win by completely destroying the opposition, or forcing them to surrender... That's it! That's the only rule!

So let's now show you which exciting lineups we've assembled for today's deathmatch brawl:

Team A: The United States Military

Authors notes:

On paper, I'd probably give the edge to the US military industrial complex. It might be controversial, but hear me out, the ability to deploy thousands of nukes, and vaporise the bummers from orbit might just tip things in their favour. Achievements wise, its probably a toss-up, but I imagine that the bookies are going to be on the conservative side with their odds this time around. I reached out to our military correspondent at CNN and got the following response: "Dear Sir, please stop contacting us on this email address, this is our final warning before we contact the police".

May the best team win!

02/06/2021, 11:20 - Qck: why did I make the message bigger
02/06/2021, 11:20 - Lockers: Looool where are the quotes from?
02/06/2021, 11:20 - Paul: Then I've already won
02/06/2021, 11:21 - Qck: it literally feels like I've woke up and had a stroke having read half of it
02/06/2021, 11:21 - Paul: Yeah I agree it's a tough call
02/06/2021, 11:22 - Qck: not going back in, going to make myself a coffee to convince myself that ny slurred speech and slack skin are due to the bong and not your wicked strokey words
02/06/2021, 11:22 - Qck: my* point proven send help
02/06/2021, 11:23 - Kirky: If we can lure them into a drinking game I think we win
02/06/2021, 11:23 - Wezz: Mate, we'd bang out the US military what do you meEeeaaAaaann?!???!?
02/06/2021, 11:25 - Wezz: Their accomplishments were from >50 years ago. We won Clash LAST WEEKEND. Get on our level.
02/06/2021, 11:25 - Mike: Just lure them into an oil rich foreign country, come back in 20 years once the sheep herders have made them quit. We finish them in their exhausted state
02/06/2021, 11:26 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
02/06/2021, 11:26 - Wezz: We've seen it all man.
02/06/2021, 11:27 - Wezz: Paul, can you add this to our Strategy section? Thanks.
02/06/2021, 11:32 - Paul: We consulted several experts for our reviews. Unfortunately they are finalised
02/06/2021, 12:53 - Noone: <Media omitted>
02/06/2021, 12:54 - Paul: Just watched it. Was amazing.
02/06/2021, 12:54 - Paul: You reckon he's actually ok? Some of that was either incredible acting or he's legit having a fair bit of trouble
02/06/2021, 12:58 - Paul: Yeah a few things I've watched/read recently have made me pretty introspective of phone usage and internet in general.
02/06/2021, 12:58 - Qck: think he's just being honest
02/06/2021, 13:23 - Lockers: Why not both
02/06/2021, 13:24 - Wezz: Yeah he's always been pretty open about his anxiety/fears of insignificance. Also think it acts as a sort of disclaimer before he complains as a white dude about the world.
02/06/2021, 13:35 - Wezz: Also totally agree. Ability to communicate instantly, internationally, is something it's impossible to be prepared for. You lose that, closure of a feedback loop you get with traditional local actions and comms. Recipe for depression and helplessness.
02/06/2021, 13:36 - Wezz: Add in increased awareness of global corruption and insufficiencies. And pow.
02/06/2021, 13:39 - Wezz: Some blame capitalism, some advise to eat the rich. I say take action locally so you can measure outcomes, publicise the action through the internet, and watch the butterfly effect. Then queue up for another game of League.

02/06/2021, 13:48 - Paul: Eat your local rich for a more acquired taste
02/06/2021, 13:50 - Paul: The butterfly effect of this behaviour is for me to imagine wezz sweating in the hot sun picking up dog poo
02/06/2021, 13:53 - Wezz: Nah I got a dog owner to do the dirty work. I just run around playing with my new best friend

02/06/2021, 14:00 - Lockers: Looks like it could be a good football
02/06/2021, 14:02 - Wezz: When all you've got is a football degree, everything looks like a football.
02/06/2021, 14:05 - Wezz: I read this to Noora, you should've heard the scream üòÇ
02/06/2021, 14:05 - Lockers: Worth it
02/06/2021, 14:05 - Lockers: True, true
02/06/2021, 14:06 - James: Sounds pretty good, I might check it out. I'd recommend James Acaster cold lasagne 1999, similar in the theme of 'is this person okay?'
02/06/2021, 14:11 - Lockers: Anywhere to stream? I was hoping to watch this when it was out but forgot
02/06/2021, 14:12 - Wezz: Love that stand up, didn't mind bits of his newer stuff too.

Defo watch Bo, some similarities but the deep is #DEEP. Coming out of lockdown helps

02/06/2021, 15:33 - Lockers: Only used sun dream team for Non fpl

02/06/2021, 17:29 - Alex: Maybe we should add dayle back to the chat? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
02/06/2021, 17:33 - Paul: I mean. If he asks to join then sure but I see no reason for us to go chasing it again
02/06/2021, 17:37 - Qck: gotta agree with Dr. Fish here, my olive tree is bereft of branches
02/06/2021, 17:42 - Lockers: He's learning
02/06/2021, 17:46 - Kirky: He doesnt want to
02/06/2021, 17:47 - Paul: Fine by me
02/06/2021, 17:48 - Alex: I was just hoping for some more money

04/06/2021, 17:18 - Mike: Rip
04/06/2021, 17:54 - Paul: According to court documents, Storman's income is now derived primarily from "unemployment and food stamps."

Nintendo argued that each download cost it between $20 and $60

Christ they can fuck right off with that well discredited argument. How are companies still arguing that they've lost full price sales from piracy. Mental that it's even allowed at this point.
04/06/2021, 17:55 - Paul: I'd wager 80% of the roms on that site aren't even commercially available any more
04/06/2021, 17:55 - Kirky: Especially a rom site for discontinued hard ware. Any sales of cartridges would be 3rd party and Nintendo would get nothing
04/06/2021, 17:56 - Paul: Probably some ancient fossil of a judge with no clue
04/06/2021, 17:58 - Paul: Not to mention people who downloaded roms of games they already own in order to play it on pc
04/06/2021, 17:58 - Paul: Cough (every single melee player)
04/06/2021, 18:18 - Derren: I extracted mine from my mini disc
04/06/2021, 18:18 - Derren: FAK U
04/06/2021, 19:14 - Qck: That dude was profiting off of Switch ROMS, Nintendo tried to sue for 16m to bury the guy but the judge settled for something way less substantial
04/06/2021, 19:15 - Qck: Dude declares bankruptcy before the first payment is due and loses anything that is an obvious asset but that's about it
04/06/2021, 19:16 - Qck: Also he represented himself in court lmao, a man who represents himself has a client for a fool etc, ended up saying the exact opposite of his deposition
04/06/2021, 19:16 - Piper: 3v3 NEXUS BLITZ AT 8
04/06/2021, 19:17 - Piper: who's in
04/06/2021, 19:17 - Qck: Goes to show how easily mislead you are and used to your own assumptions probably
04/06/2021, 19:17 - Lockers: what's a nexus and what's a blitz?
04/06/2021, 19:18 - Qck: Bit like that guy with the Hitler dog who went to prison and people were like that's PC gone mad but no it was because the guy's defense was that it was a private video for his gf even though he uploaded it to YouTube and to his Facebook page
04/06/2021, 19:18 - Qck: I know you guys can hear me
04/06/2021, 19:57 - Paul: How does that make it better in any way? So they can bury him for it by using a ridiculous evaluation and that makes it better? Is this actually Sam? Hello?
04/06/2021, 19:58 - Paul: I read the article what else is there
04/06/2021, 20:02 - Paul: Also wasn't just switch roms my dude. That site has been up and running since way before the switch even existed and it's primary use was for older games
04/06/2021, 20:03 - Paul: Not doubting that he was an idiot for representing himself but kinda weird for you to side with the big Corp here
04/06/2021, 20:16 - Mike: Just having dinner, on at 830
04/06/2021, 20:30 - Kirky: <Media omitted>
04/06/2021, 20:36 - Kirky: It isnt that nice
04/06/2021, 20:59 - James: That's surprising
04/06/2021, 21:06 - Qck: Because he's taking away direct profit from their current gen? I'm all for piracy but come on if you think stealing licensed software isn't deserving of legal ramifications, espesh to this degree
04/06/2021, 21:06 - Paul: This is cosplay
04/06/2021, 21:07 - Paul: I don't even pirate stuff and I know that's bullshit
04/06/2021, 21:14 - Paul: Studies have shown that other than recent release blockbuster movies, piracy doesn't affect sales statistically. And in many instances have weirdly actually been shown to positively impact sales. People usually pirate for convenience or for region blocking, not just to get it for free.
04/06/2021, 21:16 - Paul: Deserves is tricky here philosophically. In terms of if you break a law = get punished, then sure. But I don't really believe strongly in the law. Copyright and product licensing is a whole other debate though. But my whole point was about their ridiculous evaluation of the value of pirated content.
04/06/2021, 21:24 - Mike: idk 1 download = 1 brand new purchase, its simple maths
04/06/2021, 21:24 - James: I wouldn't download a car
04/06/2021, 21:24 - Mike: like 1 like = 1 prayer = 1 miracles
04/06/2021, 21:24 - Mike: or something, i forget the exchange rate
04/06/2021, 21:24 - Mike: Alexa, how many prayers for a chemotherapy regime?
04/06/2021, 21:26 - Lockers: Then you're missing out
04/06/2021, 21:26 - Paul: Alexa play Russian national anthem
04/06/2021, 21:26 - Qck: It was a subscription service for people who didn't wanna buy switch games?!?
04/06/2021, 21:26 - Qck: But you're right I'm sure his service that is used to negate the switch store drove up revenue in the switch store
04/06/2021, 21:27 - Lockers: Got you on the ropes here Paul
04/06/2021, 21:28 - Paul: No it wasn't though. It's a free to use website that offers a faster download subscription. Those funds aren't the same
04/06/2021, 21:28 - Qck: Nah don't worry the people who were subscribed were region blocked from playing breath of the wild
04/06/2021, 21:28 - Lockers: Ohhhh comeback
04/06/2021, 21:28 - Paul: Switch games weren't even their primary use. Because switch emulators are still dog shit
04/06/2021, 21:29 - Paul: They deliberately mention the switch ROMs because it's the only roms they can even remotely claim they lost value over. Despite the website mostly dealing with old NES and N64 ROMs
04/06/2021, 21:30 - Qck: They lose value over all ROMs hence the NES and SNES emus on the switch
04/06/2021, 21:31 - Paul: You mean those emulators that only support a handful of directly licensed games?
04/06/2021, 21:31 - Paul: And barely any 3rd party roms
04/06/2021, 21:31 - Qck: Nintendo are pretty stringent about their copyright but I mean they hired the dude who made the original NES emu to make the one in animal crossing right
04/06/2021, 21:32 - Qck: Yeah just because Nintendo don't give you access to their full library doesn't mean you deserve it for free you maniac
04/06/2021, 21:32 - Paul: If it's not available, how can they lose value from it m8
04/06/2021, 21:32 - Paul: gg
04/06/2021, 21:33 - Qck: Because if every cunt has chrono trigger illegally downloaded where's the interest when it's on the eshop
04/06/2021, 21:33 - Qck: gg now back to napster with u
04/06/2021, 21:34 - Paul: So you're saying because they might put it on the store in the future. They can claim every pirated version is lost revenue.
04/06/2021, 21:34 - Qck: Yeah and they did and they won
04/06/2021, 21:34 - Paul: Seems more like people just choosing convenience
04/06/2021, 21:34 - Paul: Yeah and OJ got off too bro what a crap argument eat my ass
04/06/2021, 21:35 - Paul: Don't make me get Dayle
04/06/2021, 21:38 - Qck: ok think of it this way: marvin gaye's estate one day decides they're only letting us listen to only thru the grapevine

well wezz has the entire discography in flac format and wants to sell it to the masses

marvin gaye's estate in this instance have every right to say to wezz no you can't do that, we have the publishing rights, here's a cease and desist

...and then wezz represents himself in court
04/06/2021, 21:39 - Qck: I can try and explain it in a more simple format using emojis and peppa pig quotes if you'd like
04/06/2021, 21:39 - Paul: Yeah so in that scenario I'm on wezzs side without question lmao
04/06/2021, 21:39 - Paul: They can shove their rights up their ass that's retarded
04/06/2021, 21:40 - Qck: You can be on his side because we all like Gaye bro and sexual healing is the song I play when I fuck your mom
04/06/2021, 21:40 - Qck: But that's not how publishing works and if it was the way you wanted it it would be a madhouse
04/06/2021, 21:40 - Qck: Eat my shorts
04/06/2021, 21:40 - Paul: Do you think that I'm doubting that people get punished for commuting crimes?
04/06/2021, 21:40 - Paul: Committing
04/06/2021, 21:40 - Paul: I'm saying it's retarded and that their logic is broken
04/06/2021, 21:41 - Qck: No I'm doubting your intellectual faculties bro
04/06/2021, 21:41 - Paul: Same way I know you're blazed up rn but don't think you should go to jail for it
04/06/2021, 21:43 - Paul: They are welcome to arrest a distributor of their works. But the gall to claim millions in lost revenue is bullfuck retarded even after the judge cut it in half. Claiming full retail price per rom downloaded goes against the science and statistics and also any person using basic common sense.
04/06/2021, 21:43 - Qck: Blazed up
04/06/2021, 21:43 - Qck: There's a reason why coolroms is still operating anyway
04/06/2021, 21:43 - Qck: Because they're not so blatant with trying to extract money from their userbase
04/06/2021, 21:43 - Paul: Yeah probably true
04/06/2021, 21:43 - Qck: Judge put it to like 15%
04/06/2021, 21:44 - Paul: Sorry m8 is this not the current mumble rap lingo. I'll brush up for next time
04/06/2021, 21:44 - Qck: Nintendo always go nuclear on stuff like this it's not really the judge's fault that those japs believe in samurai values
04/06/2021, 21:46 - Paul: Where are you getting this. It says it went from like 4 million to 2 million in the article
04/06/2021, 21:47 - Qck: I read like two other articles not that one so I dunno bro, they wanted double digits tho
04/06/2021, 21:47 - Qck: Old story
04/06/2021, 21:47 - Paul: That's cheating

04/06/2021, 21:49 - Paul: Ok folks shows over. Until next time
04/06/2021, 21:52 - Lockers: Proud of you man, I knew you would
05/06/2021, 09:59 - Paul: @447588936693 @447757709019 you seen this HAX mental breakdown about Leffen?
05/06/2021, 09:59 - Derren: I heard he's been having some issues lately in general
05/06/2021, 09:59 - Derren: Everybody calling him crazy
05/06/2021, 09:59 - Derren: üòÇ
05/06/2021, 10:00 - Paul: He released a 2.5 hour video about how Leffen is destroying melee and is an evil monster. Along with a 135 page document. He just rambles about him like a deranged maniac
05/06/2021, 10:00 - Paul: Starts off with a Hitler quotation
05/06/2021, 10:00 - Kirky: What the fuck
05/06/2021, 10:01 - Paul: Leffen is contacting a lawyer and asking for protection at tournaments
05/06/2021, 10:01 - Derren: He likes writing very long documents about melee
05/06/2021, 10:01 - Paul: Melee not even once

05/06/2021, 13:52 - Mike: Sweet corn
05/06/2021, 13:52 - Mike: Some kinda chewy mess
05/06/2021, 14:38 - Wezz: What is this place?
05/06/2021, 14:39 - Wezz: What _is_ this place?
05/06/2021, 14:39 - Wezz: What is this _place_?
05/06/2021, 14:39 - Wezz: _What_ is this place?
05/06/2021, 14:39 - Wezz: What is _this_ place?
05/06/2021, 14:45 - Mike: What's this?
05/06/2021, 14:45 - Mike: What's this?
05/06/2021, 14:45 - Mike: There's something all around
05/06/2021, 14:45 - Piper: Hello?
05/06/2021, 14:45 - Mike: This doesn't work
05/06/2021, 14:53 - Paul: Wtf is going on here are you all having a collective stroke?
05/06/2021, 14:57 - Mike: This doesn't work
05/06/2021, 14:57 - Wezz: There's magic on the ground
05/06/2021, 14:58 - Piper: Is that by bo Burnham?
05/06/2021, 15:07 - Wezz: This message was deleted
05/06/2021, 15:07 - Wezz: This doesn't work
05/06/2021, 15:21 - Wezz: The average income in the most capitalist quartile of countries is an astonishing 6 times higher, in real terms, than the average income in the least capitalist economies ($36,770 and $6,140 respectively). For the poorest in society, this gap widens even more. The bottom 10 percent of income earners in the most capitalist countries make, on average, 7 times more than the poorest 10 percent in the least free economies. Similarly, more than 27 percent of people in the most socialist economies live in extreme poverty (as defined by the World Bank as an income of less than $1.90 a day), whereas just 1.8 percent of people in freest economies live in extreme poverty ‚Äì a figure that is still too high (the optimal number is zero), but vastly better than the level that persists in the least free countries. üëÄ

05/06/2021, 15:23 - Paul: All countries are capitalist
05/06/2021, 15:23 - Paul: I'd wager that correlation also follows developed vs undeveloped
05/06/2021, 15:24 - Wezz: Yeah - 100% it does
05/06/2021, 15:24 - Qck: I'm Lars Bigdich
05/06/2021, 15:36 - Mike: Poor countries tend to be poor, more to follow at 11
05/06/2021, 15:44 - Paul: You giving it bruv?
05/06/2021, 16:27 - Mike: Tell Julia to put your leash back in unless you wanna get a round 2 from Qck and his strange artistic (autistic?) legalese

05/06/2021, 20:16 - Paul: So thats tonight yeah?
05/06/2021, 20:16 - Paul: Back IN??
05/06/2021, 20:16 - Derren: @447835575116 Fyi a lot of people are actually agreeing with Hax the way Leffen actually deals with situations
05/06/2021, 20:16 - Derren: I've seen it to from watching his streams etc he is in general a cunt but claims to be morally superior all the time
05/06/2021, 20:16 - Qck: <Media omitted>
05/06/2021, 20:17 - Paul: Dude he compared him to Stalin unironically
05/06/2021, 20:18 - Paul: Leffen isn't the first gamer to be a manipulative arsehole. But hax is clearly off the deep end and insanely obsessed
05/06/2021, 20:19 - Paul: Piper sitting there smug over his chess board.
05/06/2021, 20:20 - Kirky: What's the big tub/ box?
05/06/2021, 20:21 - Paul: Jack Noones remains
05/06/2021, 20:22 - Derren: Secret gang meetups

05/06/2021, 23:21 - Wezz: I don't know what DA means? Is it football TERMINOLOGY?
05/06/2021, 23:30 - Lockers: I'm trying to be cool and shortening deathadder üò¢
06/06/2021, 00:19 - Mike: 10/10 would DA again

06/06/2021, 12:27 - James: üòÇ
06/06/2021, 13:33 - Kirky: <Media omitted>
06/06/2021, 13:33 - James: Turns out I'm the best league player ever, I killed Mike last night
06/06/2021, 13:33 - James: So embarrassing for him
06/06/2021, 13:33 - Kirky: i 100% believe that to be true
06/06/2021, 13:34 - Mike: üò≠
06/06/2021, 13:34 - James: I did also have a game where I went 0-19, but I think that was lag or something
06/06/2021, 16:48 - Wezz: We've officially replaced Dayle. Just need to AFK order food mid game, every game.
06/06/2021, 16:49 - Wezz: The fact in the England friendly all the players took a knee for BLM and the crowd boo'd. God this Euro's gonna be a mess.
06/06/2021, 16:49 - Paul: This isn't looking good for the corona gaming deathmatch
06/06/2021, 17:00 - Lockers: Irk?
06/06/2021, 17:01 - Lockers: Irl*
06/06/2021, 17:03 - Paul: Bummers vs US military
06/06/2021, 17:03 - Wezz: Lockers, why do the fans boo when the players take a knee?
06/06/2021, 17:04 - Paul: Because football fans are all dumb as fuck. Certified dr. Paul
06/06/2021, 17:04 - Wezz: Are they racist retards?
06/06/2021, 17:04 - Lockers: Think the players are diving
06/06/2021, 17:05 - Wezz: Ah thanks man. That helps me understand
06/06/2021, 17:05 - Paul: If you look closely at the crowd you can see Jack Noone reporting the players to HR
06/06/2021, 17:12 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
06/06/2021, 17:13 - Wezz: Thoughts on current England team? Greilish seems like a cool dude
06/06/2021, 17:14 - Paul: 4th place
06/06/2021, 17:14 - Lockers: Don't like him but he's rather good at the football
06/06/2021, 17:15 - Wezz: I'd take 4th place 100%.
06/06/2021, 17:15 - Wezz: Just me. 1v11
06/06/2021, 17:15 - Paul: Oh shit do you know him?
06/06/2021, 17:15 - Lockers: Yeah
06/06/2021, 17:15 - Paul: 1st place Croatia
2nd place France
3rd place Belgium
06/06/2021, 17:15 - Paul: Feel free to remember that
06/06/2021, 17:16 - Lockers: If Croatia and France somehow get to the final then France would win
06/06/2021, 17:16 - Paul: I'm from the future
06/06/2021, 17:18 - Paul: I'm gonna set up the fantasy football tomorrow. Fiver entry good with everyone?
06/06/2021, 17:18 - Wezz: Nah, both teams would take to one knee at the start, but France's fear of being labelled racist would make them continue on one knee for the duration of the game. Viva Croatia üá≠üá∑
06/06/2021, 17:19 - Wezz: Yeah I'll have Croatia please
06/06/2021, 17:19 - Wezz: I was thinking more like ¬£500 entry
06/06/2021, 17:19 - Paul: Wait I just looked at the real odds. Are England legit the favourites? Wtf
06/06/2021, 17:20 - Lockers: Yeah
06/06/2021, 17:20 - Lockers: Joint with France
06/06/2021, 17:21 - Wezz: France favourites in a few places
06/06/2021, 17:21 - Paul: Hungary 500/1
06/06/2021, 17:21 - Paul: Worth a quid
06/06/2021, 17:21 - Paul: Better chance than Logan Paul
06/06/2021, 17:22 - Wezz: Whole team had their legs amputated, from the knee down. Virtue signalling cunts
06/06/2021, 17:22 - Wezz: Knee ball
06/06/2021, 17:22 - Paul: Do they wear football boots on their knees like when a comedian pretends to be a midget?
06/06/2021, 17:23 - Paul: Who knew midgets supported black lives so much
06/06/2021, 17:23 - Wezz: They did it before it was cool
06/06/2021, 17:24 - Paul: Is having knees a prerequisite of supporting anti racism?
06/06/2021, 17:24 - Lockers: Wait is this Monday 3am?!
06/06/2021, 17:24 - Paul: Like, can full on leg amputees still do it somehow or are they just automatically RSVPd to the lynching?
06/06/2021, 17:30 - Wezz: Yeah tomorrow morning dude
06/06/2021, 17:30 - Lockers: Bit of a retarded time. Do people not have jobs?
06/06/2021, 17:31 - Kirky: yea how can they be expected to box at peak perfomance at 3am?? surely theyll be tired?
06/06/2021, 17:31 - Paul: Lmao
06/06/2021, 17:32 - Paul: Logan Paul is part owl. He can only operate after dark
06/06/2021, 17:32 - Kirky: will that allow him to a do comedy cartoon headspin when mayweather hits him in the face?
06/06/2021, 17:33 - Paul: Yeah if he gets 3 full rotations it pops off
06/06/2021, 17:33 - Wezz: Logan Paul is going to get his face destroyed
06/06/2021, 17:33 - Lockers: Was more that it's a Sunday evening
06/06/2021, 17:34 - Qck: Is this your version of fantasy football?
06/06/2021, 17:35 - Wezz: Some straight up ableism bullshit, no more kneeling.
06/06/2021, 17:36 - Wezz: Just put a post it note on your forehead with your message. E.g. Hi Mum
06/06/2021, 17:38 - Mike: If Mayweather is smart and money hungry he'd let Logan win through some controversy, create a beef that he can keep cashing in again and again
06/06/2021, 17:39 - Wezz: Yeah, but Mayweather is a professional. He's going to beat Logan. Then Jake for the double
06/06/2021, 17:39 - Wezz: Tyron Woodley probably going to destroy Jake before then, they got a rematch clause in contract too. So possible Jake v Tyron twice
06/06/2021, 17:39 - Mike: 2v1 at once?
06/06/2021, 17:44 - Kirky: <Media omitted>
06/06/2021, 17:46 - Wezz: I honestly think so.
06/06/2021, 17:55 - Paul: Does he even need the money at this point. Isn't he close to being a billionaire? Why is he continuing to be punched in the face for money
06/06/2021, 17:57 - Wezz: Literally the easiest fights of his entire career by an insane margin
06/06/2021, 17:58 - Wezz: Imagine someone asked you to play csgo Vs 2 year old for 150 million pounds
06/06/2021, 17:58 - Wezz: Plus he almost went bankrupt few years ago
06/06/2021, 17:58 - Paul: Yeah but why bother? Literally don't see the upside? He adds to his already impossible to spend wealth vs incredibly small chance of him somehow losing and embarrassing his entire career and boxing in general
06/06/2021, 17:58 - Wezz: IRS issues. Got about 200 cars
06/06/2021, 17:58 - Wezz: All that good shit
06/06/2021, 17:58 - Paul: Ah I didn't know that. That explains it
06/06/2021, 17:59 - Wezz: His dream is generational wealth
06/06/2021, 17:59 - Wezz: His daughter stabbed some rando girl recently
06/06/2021, 17:59 - Wezz: Massive court case pending
06/06/2021, 17:59 - Wezz: Recently a grandad
06/06/2021, 17:59 - Paul: Right but isn't he just beyond beyond generational wealth at this point?
06/06/2021, 17:59 - Wezz: Dude has always been about that dollar
06/06/2021, 17:59 - Paul: Like a few million can last generations if used wisely lol
06/06/2021, 18:00 - Wezz: His thing is he doesn't use it wisely
06/06/2021, 18:00 - Qck: And he used to beat their mum in front of them
06/06/2021, 18:00 - Wezz: Plus likes to punch his wife
06/06/2021, 18:00 - Qck: Circle of life
06/06/2021, 18:01 - Wezz: She's happy he's fighting at work and not at home
06/06/2021, 18:01 - Qck: He can't help it he's always been a workaholic
06/06/2021, 18:01 - Qck: Built different üò§
06/06/2021, 18:01 - Wezz: "we can work from home, oh-oh oh oh"
06/06/2021, 18:01 - Wezz: No Floyd noooo
06/06/2021, 18:02 - Wezz: _I've taken a knee in my shower for my ridicule of domestic violence_
06/06/2021, 18:05 - Paul: Imagine having a guaranteed easy life ahead of you and all you have to do is not stab someone
06/06/2021, 18:16 - Wezz: Do you remember that Trump guy? What a weirdo. Doesn't even have a Twitter account
06/06/2021, 18:36 - Wezz: I'm glad we're getting penalties, no chance of scoring otherwise
06/06/2021, 18:37 - Lockers: You know that this is nothing like the team next week?
06/06/2021, 18:37 - Wezz: was wondering where harry kane is
06/06/2021, 18:37 - Wezz: this keeper is sick though, that pickford guy is meh
06/06/2021, 18:38 - Lockers: Henderson better than both imo
06/06/2021, 18:39 - Lockers: 4 of the players that have played fonihht
06/06/2021, 18:39 - Lockers: Tonight
06/06/2021, 18:39 - Lockers: Sorry five with this sub
06/06/2021, 18:39 - Lockers: Weren't even named in the 26 going to the tournament
06/06/2021, 18:40 - Wezz: Fair dos. That gives me hope
06/06/2021, 18:41 - Lockers: Oh fuck that
06/06/2021, 18:41 - Lockers: Don't have hope with engerland
06/06/2021, 18:45 - Wezz: First I'm seeing of Godfrey, not enjoying it
06/06/2021, 18:45 - Lockers: He's a decent defender
06/06/2021, 18:46 - Wezz: Been on the end of a lot, but zero danger of scoring
06/06/2021, 18:47 - Lockers: Sorry I think I'm lost, what group is this?
06/06/2021, 18:47 - Wezz: I thought we'd put out our best team to crush ahead of next Sunday's game.. champions league final ruined it i guess
06/06/2021, 18:47 - Lockers: Don't get it. A week to recover from last week and whole week til next game
06/06/2021, 18:48 - Wezz: They don't earn enough to play that frequently...
06/06/2021, 18:49 - Alex: Isnt this a warm up game though? So it's just testing different strategies and ideas?
06/06/2021, 18:50 - Lockers: Not even that. Just getting match fitness up
06/06/2021, 18:50 - Alex: What? They've all just finished the prem, while having a small break, arent they all fit?
06/06/2021, 18:51 - Lockers: Fair comment
06/06/2021, 18:52 - Lockers: Fit != match fit
06/06/2021, 18:52 - Lockers: They peak on a weekly basis generally so
06/06/2021, 19:59 - Noone: <Media omitted>
06/06/2021, 20:07 - Lockers: Did I miss the chat in here about anonymous' latest video re elon musk?
06/06/2021, 20:08 - Paul: Don't think so?
06/06/2021, 20:11 - Lockers: Thought you nerds would be all over that shit

06/06/2021, 20:39 - Paul: I thought all the OG anonymous guys were arrested ages ago
06/06/2021, 20:39 - Wezz: What is this garbage YouTube channel?
06/06/2021, 20:41 - Wezz: Anonymous died in 2000's, this is some movie scaremonger shit. All words no actions, like the previous two vids.

4chan is Reddit+ these days.
06/06/2021, 20:44 - Paul: Yeah I mean. Wezz and I clearly disagree about Musk but he's totally right here. This is cringey bullshit.
06/06/2021, 20:45 - Qck: why this nigga in the matrix
06/06/2021, 20:46 - Paul: Is it meant to be satire? Dunno if I ate the onion
06/06/2021, 20:50 - Lockers: Thought it was a bit much

07/06/2021, 09:54 - Wezz: He went in, got his 3 second tiktok clip, and went home
07/06/2021, 09:54 - Wezz: No spoilers but what a boring show
07/06/2021, 10:25 - Kirky: "Landed 2 hits in (relatively) quick succession on floyd Mayweather" right at the top of his cv
07/06/2021, 10:26 - Paul: Nah top of the CV will be a tinyurl to the soundbite of what Mayweather said in his corner (but I guess we're doing no spoilers atm)

07/06/2021, 12:02 - Paul: Weird, I don't remember Magnus failing to checkmate a youtuber ü§î
07/06/2021, 12:02 - Qck: I don't remember Magnus being 45 years old
07/06/2021, 12:03 - Paul: Oh right, now that's relevant
07/06/2021, 12:03 - Qck: Also pretty sure he's lost exhibit matches to people who aren't ranked as GM, find another slant you grease fuck
07/06/2021, 12:04 - Paul: Magnus has never lost a game vs a non-GM since he was like 12 lol
07/06/2021, 12:04 - Qck: Neither has Floyd
07/06/2021, 12:05 - Paul: Copium because your old man couldn't knock out a youtuber
07/06/2021, 12:05 - Qck: Bro he landed 10% of his punches, I dunno why you're pretending combat sports is your wheelhouse when you'd break your wrist throwing a jab
07/06/2021, 12:06 - Paul: Weird how his age didn't matter here üßê
07/06/2021, 12:06 - Qck: Yeah and he was?!
07/06/2021, 12:07 - Qck: What fight did you watch? The one where the 6'3 guy clinched all the time knowing no points could be deducted whilst getting pieced up after the clinch by the GOAT?
07/06/2021, 12:07 - Qck: Honestly shocking opinion
07/06/2021, 12:08 - Paul: The one where Mayweather tried his hardest to knock out an amateur boxer and failed looooooooooool
07/06/2021, 12:08 - Qck: Ah yeah Mayweather the power puncher
07/06/2021, 12:08 - Paul: And got smacked in the face despite you saying it was impossible
07/06/2021, 12:08 - Qck: Sit down and stick to watching Valorant
07/06/2021, 12:08 - Paul: hahaha
07/06/2021, 12:09 - Qck: He landed 10%?!?!?! That's not a statistic ever seen in a pro boxing match
07/06/2021, 12:09 - Paul: Who are we kidding m8, either of us are fighters ‚ù§Ô∏è
07/06/2021, 12:09 - Qck: He landed 10% on a guy 3 times as small as him?
07/06/2021, 12:09 - Qck: Dunno what you're taking about, you're getting a swift check hook in the mouth when I see you
07/06/2021, 12:10 - Paul: Oh so now weight is also important, weird how it wasn't before
07/06/2021, 12:10 - Qck: ???
07/06/2021, 12:10 - Qck: Floyd beat him in an exhibit match and your takeaway is he didn't knockout Logan Paul so that makes him the loser?
07/06/2021, 12:10 - Qck: I get it you don't watch boxing and want to annoy me, but you're a moron
07/06/2021, 12:11 - Paul: You ignored the fact that he weighs like 20kg more or something, and is in his 20s vs 44, you were so confident he'd get knocked out and not land a punch. He said himself that he couldn't hit him
07/06/2021, 12:11 - Paul: just funny as fuck
07/06/2021, 12:11 - Qck: I didn't say he'd get knocked out you dummy
07/06/2021, 12:11 - Qck: I said he wouldn't land against floyd
07/06/2021, 12:11 - Qck: Floyd doesn't KO people and never has, he's always sold tickets on if his opponent can KO him
07/06/2021, 12:11 - Paul: whoops
07/06/2021, 12:12 - Paul: hahaha
07/06/2021, 12:12 - Qck: Yeah and between rounds 3-6 that's what happened? And Logan just locked him up in cuddles
07/06/2021, 12:12 - Qck: Dude just committed a bank robbery and you think it was a close fight
07/06/2021, 12:12 - Paul: This is great lmao

07/06/2021, 12:22 - Qck: You'd be Hugo Paul
07/06/2021, 12:23 - Paul: Only if I get to embarrass another one of your heros
07/06/2021, 12:24 - Qck: Well you've embarrassed yourself with "heros" if that counts

07/06/2021, 15:02 - Wezz: That's cool, US government should do the same
07/06/2021, 15:07 - Noone: Why is the minimum wage different for 21 and 22 year olds? Seems like a pointless distinction
07/06/2021, 15:07 - Noone: Is it just to make more out of students at uni?
07/06/2021, 15:09 - Mike: at the age of 22 you are told the secrets of the underdark, making you a more proficient worker in all aspects. Hence the $2 an hour
07/06/2021, 16:22 - Wezz: We use post graduate education to make more out of students.
07/06/2021, 16:22 - James: I guess it's average responsibilities and outgoings, I'd assume that as you said, uni student bring down the average, but there are enough people who have started families then that it needs to be bumped
07/06/2021, 16:53 - Mike: Imagine if his rocket exploded, Amazon send him an "Your order has been cancelled" email

07/06/2021, 17:19 - Wezz: Isn't that what child benefits are supposed to support? (disclaimer, children are gay)
07/06/2021, 17:19 - Lockers: I guess this is why he took a step back from amazon
07/06/2021, 17:20 - James: Well, children was just one example, higher rent, more utilities etc
07/06/2021, 17:20 - James: You wouldn't need children for higher cost of living in early 20s
07/06/2021, 17:21 - Wezz: Isn't that what minimum wage calculation is supposed to support?
07/06/2021, 17:21 - James: Exactly
07/06/2021, 17:22 - James: but someone who's 16 won't normally have the same outgoings as a 21 year old, and someone who is 23-24 will probaby have slightly more, hence the brackets
07/06/2021, 17:24 - Wezz: Yeah, alcohol's expensive, i agree. Thanks James, you're the best.
07/06/2021, 17:25 - Mike: Don't tell me when I can have kids

07/06/2021, 17:45 - Paul: I'm with Jack though it's hella arbitrary.
07/06/2021, 18:59 - James: So is life Paul, So is life
07/06/2021, 22:21 - Qck: In our DnD session this evening Paul's character tried to kill Mike's character when they were alone, only to be big dicked by Mike and banished to some demonic hellhole
07/06/2021, 22:22 - Lockers: Wtf are you on about

08/06/2021, 10:45 - Derren: Did you know that "Take exercise" is a thing?
08/06/2021, 10:46 - James: Yeah, I see it as the opposite of taking a break
08/06/2021, 10:46 - James: Gotta take exercise
08/06/2021, 10:48 - Derren: You would use take exercise? I would have said do more, I dunno it sounds wrong in my head
08/06/2021, 10:50 - James: My morning routine:
I take breakfast in the office, taking my tea hot and full of sugar. I then take exercise if I'm feeling good, maybe taking a run around the block, before taking a shower, taking my time if I'm early. Finally, I take myself to the bedroom, before I take a few calls as work starts.
08/06/2021, 10:51 - James: I'm no give, all take
08/06/2021, 10:51 - Wezz: Are you taking the piss?

08/06/2021, 11:13 - Lee: Yeah, I take it with a pinch of salt. But the content is super interesting!

UFC president Dana White replied "SOON" to an Instagram comment asking "When will full healthcare benefits be given to fighters?"

Share prices took a big hit overnight. Next day he says his reply was an accident.

https://streamable.com/bdxn2n
08/06/2021, 13:53 - Mike: God that's hilarious
08/06/2021, 13:54 - Wezz: Obviously he doesn't mention the share prices.. I just slipped that bit in. Completely unrelated of
08/06/2021, 13:58 - Mike: In his defence, I assume there is an unending supply of bodies who are willing to be punched in the head for a living
08/06/2021, 13:58 - Mike: Some people do that for free
08/06/2021, 14:00 - Paul: Are fighters in civilised countries covered for standard healthcare?
08/06/2021, 14:02 - Wezz: Unfortunately, you're correct.

But you'd think when your employees fight each other 1 on 1 in a cage that you should probably be accountable for health care.
08/06/2021, 14:02 - Wezz: Sorry. Contractors not employees. That's why üßê
08/06/2021, 14:06 - Paul: I was genuinely asking I wasn't being sarcastic. Do UK fighters still get all the free shit? Or do they waive their rights to it or something
08/06/2021, 14:19 - Wezz: Yeah pretty sure they do. We treat everyone, same drunk idiots end up in hospital every night. It's only if they're a danger to staff that they can be abandoned (I think..)
08/06/2021, 14:19 - Wezz: And that requires a tonne of paperwork and third party opinion etc.
08/06/2021, 14:51 - Paul: I just wondered if by prearranging to cause damage to each other there's some argument that they should incur the cost of their own damages
08/06/2021, 14:51 - Paul: Goes against the spirit of free healthcare I guess
08/06/2021, 15:07 - Mike: Think you could argue they don't aim to cause permanent/hospital requiring damage, they have ringside docs and such.

08/06/2021, 16:43 - Mike: Jack's anus' ability to handle food is well documented and as such our company liability is limited at best
08/06/2021, 16:44 - Mike: Also consider the maintenance of said Anus which is performed by Jack himself and an army of ready meals prepared by the cheapest bidder
08/06/2021, 16:45 - Mike: Your honour I move to counter sue for slander
08/06/2021, 17:31 - Noone: Talking to mate at work about how little body hair I have. Told him I should have been born a woman, and that if I was born 10 years later than I was I'd be prime target for trans therapy
08/06/2021, 17:31 - Noone: said it way too loud oof
08/06/2021, 17:48 - James: So now everyone in the office is pitching in to get you converted?
08/06/2021, 17:49 - James: To be fair, it's a win win for you, you avoid the office drama and you could start dating Asian boys and no one would blink an eye
08/06/2021, 17:50 - Noone: I'm on my to the Travistock Centre right now, they said I can either keep my scrotum as a souvineir or they can feed it to their resident rabbi

09/06/2021, 15:41 - Wezz: Probably forgets McDonald's sauces too
09/06/2021, 15:42 - Wezz: Chips are nice and salty from the tears though, 3/5 stars
09/06/2021, 15:42 - James: Would have been saltier if he'd have sweat riding the bike though
09/06/2021, 15:43 - Wezz: This is the kinda 5 star mentality I'm looking for.
09/06/2021, 15:43 - James: Thanks, does that mean I earned my tip?
09/06/2021, 15:45 - Wezz: > _edit rating_
> 2 stars
> _reason_
> asked for tip
09/06/2021, 15:46 - Wezz: In all honesty. I regularly tip delivery drivers coins. Half because most of them are good and deserve it. Other half because fuck coins who even uses coins
09/06/2021, 15:47 - James: Jokes on you, tears and sweat weren't the only salty fluids I left in your chippies
09/06/2021, 15:51 - Wezz: On your wage, I'd hold on to any body fluids you can. That's nutrition in times of need.
09/06/2021, 15:51 - Mike: <Media omitted>
09/06/2021, 15:51 - Mike: Nando's needed new sounds for Restaurants when a delivery order comes in, this was the suggestion
09/06/2021, 15:52 - James: That's rubbish, what they want is this
09/06/2021, 15:52 - James: <Media omitted>
09/06/2021, 15:53 - Mike: Can I submit this to them? Vast improvement
09/06/2021, 15:53 - James: Sure, do I get royalties?
09/06/2021, 15:54 - Wezz: +1 Colonel James
09/06/2021, 15:55 - Mike: You would have if I didn't say that I had made the sound already, sorry kid it's just chicken business
09/06/2021, 15:56 - James: Damn, and I thought this was gonna be my big break
09/06/2021, 15:56 - Wezz: Have you considered something more.... Diverse?
https://youtu.be/4HziZ3yZDJY
09/06/2021, 15:57 - Mike: Sorry Sam but ACAB is the chicken shop mantra ATM and this may scare off customers
09/06/2021, 15:59 - Derren: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ-27rdwJPs
09/06/2021, 16:53 - Paul: Thanks for this nearly spat my tea
09/06/2021, 16:53 - Paul: Don't forget to sign up to fantasy football guys
09/06/2021, 17:04 - Paul: I don't really ever tip delivery drivers as I never carry cash. Is that bad?
09/06/2021, 17:13 - Noone: They don't deserve it, they provide a basic service literally anyone could do
09/06/2021, 17:13 - Derren: Nah fuck them
09/06/2021, 17:13 - Derren: ü§£
09/06/2021, 17:14 - James: I think it's a US problem predominantly
09/06/2021, 17:16 - Derren: ^
09/06/2021, 17:16 - Derren: Well here it's shit too cos you're classed as self employed but I think there's credits etc you can apply for
09/06/2021, 18:09 - Mike: https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15209715/brit-fighting-life-trying-jump-balcony-swimming-pool/

Just got word from family that this was a childhood friend of mine, always knew he was a dumb fuck
09/06/2021, 18:11 - Derren: <Media omitted>
09/06/2021, 19:05 - Noone: Christ, sad that he was as a friend, funny that it happened
09/06/2021, 19:44 - Mike: I'm sure he'll be alright, always thought he had a hard head. You should see the parasol he landed on.
09/06/2021, 20:11 - Paul: Oh dear. Sorry to hear that. Hope he pulls through
09/06/2021, 20:40 - Mike: "That's not to say these super rich folks have no money coming in to pay their yacht bills. There is a widespread tactic employed by the rich to borrow cash secured against their vast wealth - which again is not income - it's proceeds of a loan and here's the (perfectly legal) biscuit-taking bit.

The interest on that loan can be deducted from any other income to further reduce income tax liability. It sounds egregious - but it's legal."

Incase you guys ever make it rich, this is the way

10/06/2021, 11:53 - Lee: Is it one of the ones where you have to go in everyday and swap players out etc?
10/06/2021, 11:53 - Lee: Or once you've built your team that's that?
10/06/2021, 12:05 - Wezz: It's one of these ü•∫
10/06/2021, 12:05 - Wezz: Gotta login daily for subs and transfers and stuff

10/06/2021, 12:21 - Mike: If we don't login do we still get points and whatever?
10/06/2021, 12:24 - Paul: Yeah I think so. I doubt I'll log in and sub players until teams have been eliminated and then it makes sense to do some changes
10/06/2021, 12:25 - Paul: Someone want to do a monzo for the money? Wezz you can pay my fiver üòâ
10/06/2021, 12:27 - Wezz: Coolcool, yeah I'll setup a PayPal
10/06/2021, 12:32 - Wezz: How crazy - tried to setup one called Euro 2021 Fantasy and it said this isn't allowed.

10/06/2021, 13:05 - Paul: Except Sam Williams ofc
10/06/2021, 14:05 - Mike: <Media omitted>
10/06/2021, 14:06 - Derren: Hope you don't feel like shit, apparently you can get a worse reaction from the jab if you've had covid before
10/06/2021, 14:08 - Wezz: Second AZ wasn't that bad for me.. barely had any symptoms
10/06/2021, 14:08 - Mike: Wait and see time, pretty impressed with how seem less it was this time though. Clearly got the routine nailed
10/06/2021, 14:08 - James: seamless?
10/06/2021, 14:09 - Mike: Apparently auto correct thinks less of it
10/06/2021, 14:09 - James: I don't believe your autocorrect changes anything other than making things hilarious, this must be on you
10/06/2021, 14:13 - Piper: got 1 seat available this Friday is local pub to get drunk and watch first euros game, Italy vs Turkey, table 7 til close.. anyone in?
10/06/2021, 14:13 - Nathan: I had Pfizer a few days ago, was fine all day, had an achy arm from shoulder to wrist day 2 but fine again now

10/06/2021, 16:44 - Wezz: Ah, weirdly enjoy these disaster clips. Have you seen the recent one floating on 4chan of the girl who films a car crash on her Instagram story? Then her sister (clearly deceased) afterwards? So surreal, eerily silent.
10/06/2021, 16:45 - Paul: Tell me you're a ticking time bomb serial killer without telling me
10/06/2021, 16:47 - Wezz: Aren't we all? üòÇ First step is understanding your potential for evil. Then deciding not to üòá
10/06/2021, 16:47 - James: I have no potential for evil, I'm a perfect benevolent being
10/06/2021, 16:48 - Paul: Same, I'm pretty perfect. I'm especially good at being humble
10/06/2021, 16:49 - Paul: Probably the best actually, can't think of anyone more humble than me
10/06/2021, 16:49 - James: You are very good at being humble, everyone is always talking about it
10/06/2021, 16:49 - Wezz: Have you considered being less humble so you could be more humble?
10/06/2021, 16:50 - Paul: Ignore James, he's being sarcastic about me. He also picked Argon as his gas. Pathetic
10/06/2021, 16:51 - James: Your insecurity is showing Paul, I think you should rub your ego a little more and lash out at your friends again
10/06/2021, 16:51 - James: That's the last time I agree with you.
10/06/2021, 16:56 - Paul: Agreed

10/06/2021, 17:54 - Mike: This dude was an adult and he enjoyed watching the yugioh series
10/06/2021, 17:54 - Mike: too many footballs to the head
10/06/2021, 17:55 - Alex: He enjoyed it so much he is happy to be an ambassador for the series
10/06/2021, 17:55 - Paul: Yu GI Oh was awesome fuck you

10/06/2021, 22:39 - Paul: Oh yes always lurking you've just gotta mention France or the concept of Mike cheating. Some say if you just chant his name 3 times he appears too

10/06/2021, 22:41 - Paul: Derren always drops a video after someone posts an announcement so that it gets shifted out of focus. It's the law
10/06/2021, 22:41 - Wezz: I came here to mention the Elden Ring game that was demo'd, George R R Martin writing the story. Thought you nerds would eat it up

10/06/2021, 22:51 - Kirky: Looks good from the 3 seconds of gameplay it showed. More dark souls stuff is always fun, aslong as they keep the speed of 3

10/06/2021, 22:51 - Paul: Checkmate

11/06/2021, 16:10 - Kirky: You have been scammed
11/06/2021, 16:11 - Lockers: If you've sent money to anyone here, including mikes magical monza for slots, you've been scammed
11/06/2021, 16:12 - Paul: Alex has won like 50 quid or something, he's the scammer

11/06/2021, 17:07 - Piper: We lose this stage
11/06/2021, 17:08 - Piper: If we come 2nd in group we win the tourny
11/06/2021, 17:08 - Piper: Heard here first

11/06/2021, 17:28 - James: I don't know what advantage that is, or how to exploit it?
11/06/2021, 17:29 - James: If you send me a picture of your team, then explain how that gives me the edge, I'd appreciate it
11/06/2021, 17:31 - Qck: Looks like we've got ourselves a fantasy football shark here
11/06/2021, 17:35 - Mike: They don't call him Mr fantasy for nothing

12/06/2021, 14:54 - Paul: This guy predicted the result, the scorers and the own goal I mean wtf. Million typewriters I guess...
12/06/2021, 14:56 - Qck: keep us abreast of any new lottery winners too
12/06/2021, 14:56 - Alex: That is fucking nuts
12/06/2021, 16:13 - James: I love how everyone is asking his questions like he's the new Messiah

12/06/2021, 17:57 - Lee: Mental
12/06/2021, 17:58 - Lee: Finally cut back to the studio
12/06/2021, 17:59 - Lockers: Couldn't believe how long it took to cut away
12/06/2021, 18:00 - Lee: They literally filmed them pumping on his chest and shocking him.
12/06/2021, 18:00 - Lee: Game postponed
12/06/2021, 18:19 - Derren: What happened
12/06/2021, 18:19 - James: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/breaking-christian-eriksen-receives-cpr-24306115.amp
12/06/2021, 18:19 - James: Sorry for amp link
12/06/2021, 18:20 - Alex: Some pictures through of him awake
12/06/2021, 18:24 - Derren: Did he just collapse himself?
12/06/2021, 18:24 - Lockers: Yes
12/06/2021, 18:24 - Lockers: It won't take you long to find it on twitter
12/06/2021, 18:24 - Lockers: I feel disgusted with those that are posting it
12/06/2021, 18:25 - Lockers: Someone threw him the ball and he collapsed receiving it
12/06/2021, 18:35 - Paul: People share way worse... this is a pretty rare thing. It's tactless but I understand why people are sharing a video of a crazy event
12/06/2021, 18:36 - Lockers: So? What's your point?
12/06/2021, 18:36 - Lockers: How can you understand that?
12/06/2021, 18:36 - Paul: How can I understand why people share stuff on the internet?
12/06/2021, 18:37 - Lockers: "I understand why people..." hello???
12/06/2021, 18:37 - Lockers: Are you ok
12/06/2021, 18:37 - Paul: What are you on about?
12/06/2021, 18:38 - Lockers: I'm quoting you?
12/06/2021, 18:38 - Paul: Are you drunk?
12/06/2021, 18:38 - Lockers: "I understand why people" to "how can't I understand why people"
12/06/2021, 18:39 - Lockers: I fucking hope I am because you're making no sense to me rn
12/06/2021, 18:39 - Paul: Let's chat in the morning mate xx
12/06/2021, 18:39 - Lockers: Read what you said though
12/06/2021, 18:39 - Paul: I have
12/06/2021, 18:50 - James: Paul is making sense here, it's something that happened that's out of the ordinary, lot's of people will upload it to let other people see it. It's not something I would do, but it's no different from people uploading footage of a car crash or other things that are virally shared, especially on twitter
12/06/2021, 18:50 - James: I think Paul wasn't saying he didn't understand, he was questioning what you were asking
12/06/2021, 18:55 - James: My phone just told me he's stabilised in hospital, don't worry chaps
12/06/2021, 18:56 - Paul: Ok good. So now we can discuss important stuff: did anyone have him for fantasy league?
12/06/2021, 18:58 - James: Is hospitalisation negative points?
12/06/2021, 18:58 - Mike: Did the prophet predict this happening?\
12/06/2021, 18:58 - Piper: i had him..
12/06/2021, 18:58 - Paul: God doesn't want you to win

13/06/2021, 00:19 - Mike: Welcome, to the internet.
13/06/2021, 01:46 - James: Can we talk about how 'Pauls Friend' who knows 'nothing about football' has 52 points after match day 1 and is wiping the floor with our league so far?!!
13/06/2021, 01:46 - Mike: Standard Paul
13/06/2021, 01:50 - Qck: that's why Paul is never seeing my fiver, I thought you were the Euro Shark but it was Boris all along

13/06/2021, 08:05 - James: I can't watch live, I'm playing DnD today, though I am invested in this game
13/06/2021, 08:06 - James: Not out of patriotism, but James and Phillips are playing for England

13/06/2021, 08:53 - James: Life, aiming to finish it in the following few hours
13/06/2021, 09:03 - Wezz: We've been stitched up. He's clearly read a guide or something.
13/06/2021, 09:05 - Paul: Everyone knows the early points guys end up last. That's why I'm slow rolling in last place
13/06/2021, 09:05 - Paul: No one wants your shitty screen play

13/06/2021, 13:42 - Wezz: @447907446727
13/06/2021, 13:42 - James: Subs close at 2 I think
13/06/2021, 13:42 - Wezz: Yeah, question is: can you sub someone on after their game has already been played?
13/06/2021, 13:43 - James: Oh, I don't know how football works, or any of these points
13/06/2021, 13:47 - Paul: anyone else gonna join us?
13/06/2021, 13:53 - Lockers: No
13/06/2021, 13:54 - Wezz: Thanks boss xx
13/06/2021, 13:54 - Wezz: Can change your formation at any point. Which is handy.
13/06/2021, 13:56 - Lockers: Yes but it's after every match day that it applies
13/06/2021, 13:56 - Lockers: Assuming it's the same as fpl
13/06/2021, 13:57 - Paul: I spent 9.5m on Sancho and he's not even playing

13/06/2021, 14:41 - Wezz: Yeah, sort that trim out when you get a minute
13/06/2021, 14:45 - James: I was thinking that if football didn't work out I might try the rap game

13/06/2021, 16:56 - Qck: Couldn't believe it when I was introduced to him, although I guess Australia doesn't have black people so any name's a-go
13/06/2021, 18:03 - Qck: <Media omitted>

13/06/2021, 19:30 - Kirky: https://youtu.be/0x6OGMh4i98
13/06/2021, 19:55 - Wezz: Imagine paying 100 million dollars for a bunch of guys to sit around doing nothing. Socialism affecting your fantasy football picks üëÄ

13/06/2021, 22:31 - Qck: Yeah, am used to square enix making jerk off turn based weeb shit, but Bethesda could have done more than show off a few sci-fi assets and a man climbing a ladder
13/06/2021, 22:31 - Qck: Still, only a year and a bit away from Skyrim in space
13/06/2021, 22:32 - Paul: Was hoping for at least a peak at es6
13/06/2021, 22:32 - Paul: Yeah this keeps me hyped at least a bit

14/06/2021, 12:03 - James: Sounds good to me, but best get the commies to sign off before they want to change the rules mid game
14/06/2021, 12:03 - Wezz: Or ¬£45 first, ¬£5 second?
14/06/2021, 12:04 - Wezz: Bloody commies love a mid game rule change, surprised qcks not hit me with a late fiver considering he's 3rd
14/06/2021, 12:04 - James: I think ¬£35 is a decent amount, still 7:1 return

14/06/2021, 17:59 - Lockers: We all know what they say but can you stop going on about it? Just in case anybody who doesn't know what they say feels left out and discriminated against
14/06/2021, 18:02 - Noone: Shut up whitie, not everything's about you
14/06/2021, 18:16 - Wezz: You're right, but you know what they say
14/06/2021, 18:17 - Lockers: Exactly, thank you for being so inclusive
14/06/2021, 18:21 - Mike: Hello friends, what's the process for removing people from Corona chat? Depending how our DND game goes today we may need to lose a few members.
14/06/2021, 18:21 - Alex: You
14/06/2021, 18:23 - Kirky: i think you just get sam to make comments until they leave of their own accord
14/06/2021, 18:23 - Wezz: You know what they say Mike...
14/06/2021, 18:23 - Wezz: We can't feel the loss of a friend until they are apart from us
14/06/2021, 18:24 - Derren: Why remove just make a new chat and leave the ones in here you don't want
14/06/2021, 18:25 - Qck: Hope you've been working on your defence for when Judge Dimble resides
14/06/2021, 18:31 - Mike: Reason will prevail

14/06/2021, 19:02 - Wezz: No, what do they say?
14/06/2021, 19:03 - Lockers: Yeah right about the time you made no sense
15/06/2021, 08:03 - Paul: Do your first beer was also when I stopped making sense? You criticise society and yet you live in a society, curious...
15/06/2021, 08:03 - Paul: So*
15/06/2021, 08:14 - Lockers: Omg you got me

15/06/2021, 09:59 - Kirky: Can always get conversion therapy
15/06/2021, 10:00 - James: I went on the logic that gay people are respectable
15/06/2021, 10:23 - Mike: The all out party on the 26th is officially postponed btw, Herr Boris has spoken to me personally and the NHS just can't bear the weight.
15/06/2021, 10:23 - Mike: Now before you all go killing yourselves we hope to instead have it at the end of July
15/06/2021, 11:30 - Wezz: Glad you got rid of all the riff raff Mike, see you on the 26th
15/06/2021, 11:30 - Wezz: Oops wrong chat
15/06/2021, 11:31 - Wezz: _your message cannot be deleted_
15/06/2021, 11:33 - James: I've already called him out for blowing us off for Clash on the 26th
15/06/2021, 11:34 - Wezz: When's your clash debut James? There's a 5 shot prerequisite
15/06/2021, 11:35 - James: Don't you need to be good at league for Clash?
15/06/2021, 11:37 - Kirky: Have you seen piper playm
15/06/2021, 11:37 - Kirky: ?

15/06/2021, 11:44 - Wezz: That's the BUMMERS way! You're hired.
15/06/2021, 11:45 - James: Look at me now Ma, I'm on a professional gaming team
15/06/2021, 11:47 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
15/06/2021, 11:50 - Kirky: Excuse me we have a corporate sponsor?
15/06/2021, 11:51 - Kirky: I'd say that makes us pretty professional
15/06/2021, 11:52 - James: Who's the sponsor?

15/06/2021, 12:02 - Wezz: Woah slow down Mr Buffett
15/06/2021, 12:02 - Wezz: We were thinking forehead tattoos but that's actually a great idea
15/06/2021, 12:05 - Kirky: I thought Jack got approval from his CEO to sponsor as paymentsens. I maybe defrauded some investors if it's just jacks warhammer cheering us on
15/06/2021, 12:16 - Paul: You idiot you were meant to post it in the non-misto chat
15/06/2021, 12:21 - Paul: Can I be too too?

I wish I could experience this man's brain sometimes
15/06/2021, 20:45 - Piper: Hern√°ndez is a widespread Spanish surname that became common around the 15th century
15/06/2021, 20:48 - Qck: Taking a bite out of Pogba? What does he taste of?
15/06/2021, 20:48 - Lockers: Oh is Spain in South America too m8?

16/06/2021, 00:37 - Wezz: New league gamemode on test environment. Faster and at start of game you pick a random ult (from 3) which takes one of your sum spell slots ü§î so you have two ults. WEIRD
16/06/2021, 07:32 - Kirky: Seen a guy post genetic females on transitioning subreddit and say they're MtF 6 on HRT, am I passable ?

16/06/2021, 09:01 - Paul: Look at this authoritarian pfft
16/06/2021, 09:01 - Noone: Also, on my commute I see a shanty town of morons camped on Sheperds Bush green. They have signs up facing the road like "Love is the best medicine" and "End the lockdown"
Where were these faggots during the first lockdown lol
16/06/2021, 09:01 - Noone: why weren't they telling me love was the best medicine when the country was dying
16/06/2021, 09:02 - Noone: thanks for reading my blog
16/06/2021, 09:03 - James: I don't think it was mandatory, I think they were just offered it really early
16/06/2021, 09:13 - Wezz: Yup. Not mandatory. But we do have some mandatory vacs e.g. for doctors/surgeons
16/06/2021, 09:15 - Wezz: I think government just wants to avoid liability of enforcing new vacs.
16/06/2021, 09:16 - Wezz: Referring to Hep B etc

16/06/2021, 14:57 - Noone: I hereby judge you all as enemies of the African individuals of the world and sentence you to life in a totally white society.
16/06/2021, 14:57 - James: I've been sending smoke signals for hours, I wondered why nobody was laughing
16/06/2021, 14:58 - Noone: https://youtu.be/mAKOs1Zm5Fo

16/06/2021, 22:12 - Alex: James and  a paedophile?
16/06/2021, 22:12 - Paul: None of you are children unless I'm mistaken? Holding hands with adults isn't a crime
16/06/2021, 22:12 - Mike: Awkward way to describe Skye's defence council but I dig it

16/06/2021, 22:27 - Mike: Can someone translate for non nerds?
16/06/2021, 22:27 - Derren: It's an "mmorpg BR" game I think
16/06/2021, 22:28 - Derren: Or some shit
16/06/2021, 22:29 - Mike: It looked like every non descript Asian mmo
16/06/2021, 22:30 - Derren: It's a battle royale tho
16/06/2021, 22:30 - Mike: Assumed it was the one you linked a free weekend on earlier
16/06/2021, 22:36 - Mike: Ok it's too hot
16/06/2021, 22:36 - Mike: Who did this
16/06/2021, 22:37 - Wezz: You know what they say!
16/06/2021, 23:16 - Qck: <Media omitted>
17/06/2021, 08:10 - Paul: The lesser known controversial Roald Dahl sequel.
17/06/2021, 08:34 - Wezz: üòÇ
17/06/2021, 08:34 - James: It was kind of the opposite of James and the giant peach, as James was inside the peach in the original...

17/06/2021, 09:23 - Wezz: Dude what even happens in the middle? Man gets tased? Ending is brilliant

17/06/2021, 09:33 - Mike: Can I black face as a disgruntled artist you imitate?
17/06/2021, 09:34 - James: Someone watched Die Hard too many times
17/06/2021, 09:35 - Paul: That's impossible
17/06/2021, 10:04 - Wezz: Just googled this, lots of resentment. People forgetting it was the 60's, literally everyone copied everyone. You type Elvis copied... Into Google and you only get black artists. Despite the majority of his songs being written by white men. Ghost writers galore. Otis Blackwell and Chuck Berry are legends in their own right weird to coat tail them
17/06/2021, 10:07 - Wezz: Guess it's just the usual stuff, mainstream pop artist stands atop the rest of the industry, as he gets all the great songs handed to him (buys the rights). When it's a massive hit you get shocked picachu resentment "that shoulda been me!"
17/06/2021, 10:22 - Mike: I dont think it was individual songs people complain about but the packaging of the genre of music and making it palatable by adding a white singer on it, vanilla ice before he was cool yo
17/06/2021, 10:23 - Mike: but idk how much that argument holds weight, seems like its a theory worth exploring when I'm drunk at 3am alone and not ready to go to bed
17/06/2021, 10:24 - Wezz: There's about 50 of these people in the world, all of them have a blog
17/06/2021, 10:24 - Paul: Well, a recording studio found that it worked. Gotta make that dolla
17/06/2021, 10:26 - Paul: If they could Dress up Ed Sheeran in full Hindi garb and make a killing in Pakistan they would do that too
17/06/2021, 10:26 - James: I'd pay to see that
17/06/2021, 10:26 - Mike: I think Beyonce did that in her coldplay song no?
17/06/2021, 10:27 - Mike: Just let Eminem know me and my woke boys are coming for his royalties
17/06/2021, 10:30 - Wezz: I wish I never knew this, fuck you Mike for giving retards attention
17/06/2021, 12:29 - Paul: Who do you reckon has the most gamer hours in this chat?
17/06/2021, 12:30 - Derren: What counts as a gamer hour
17/06/2021, 12:31 - Paul: Anything other than idling in the background
17/06/2021, 12:31 - Derren: So that includes playing mobile games?
17/06/2021, 12:32 - Paul: Hmm I guess? Don't think many of us do that though
17/06/2021, 12:34 - Mike: Yo momma
17/06/2021, 12:40 - Mike: Mark Cuban recommended an alt coin and someone was able to exploit it to get infinite coins, price went from $60 to 0 in a flash

https://twitter.com/cope_itulate/status/1405305356914290689?s=20
17/06/2021, 13:07 - Kirky: how much did that person make before it hit $0?
17/06/2021, 13:24 - Mike: Mark Cuban? who knows
17/06/2021, 13:24 - Mike: Some guy in the thread mortgaged his house when it hit $50 lmao
17/06/2021, 13:25 - Lockers: Derek or pipper
17/06/2021, 13:26 - Lockers: I'm the least because I'm _not a gamer nerd_
17/06/2021, 13:27 - Wezz: Prob Derren if we count Aion as "gaming"
17/06/2021, 13:29 - Wezz: We should do a steam profile check, who's got most hours played? Include league/wow/any other major game hours I guess. Put so many hours in before steam but w/e
17/06/2021, 13:33 - Derren: I have 2k hours on steam, not representative at all :D

17/06/2021, 13:43 - Piper: How you see league hours?
17/06/2021, 13:43 - Piper: I would go for me also

17/06/2021, 14:21 - Derren: <Media omitted>
17/06/2021, 14:22 - Derren: You have 300 more hours in csgo than I do :o
17/06/2021, 14:25 - James: Once upon a time I taught Paul how to play, alas, those years are lost to time now
17/06/2021, 15:13 - Paul: I think if we add in blizzard games it might not be piper. Mike has like a lifetime in wow. And so does kirky with wow and sc2
17/06/2021, 15:14 - Paul: Yeah I had 3k hours for css on xfire before steam even recorded it lol. I'm easily over 10k for counterstrike in total
17/06/2021, 15:18 - Qck: this chat is turning my phone into a virgin
17/06/2021, 15:19 - Alex: Are you saying you've fucked your phone?
17/06/2021, 15:19 - Paul: Yeah games are for losers man. Anyway let play DnD
17/06/2021, 15:19 - Alex: It's alright because he has had numerous sexual encounters with a horse, so it's cool!

17/06/2021, 16:26 - James: I was talking more about the 3.6 hours in the two games above
17/06/2021, 16:26 - James: 3.6k*
17/06/2021, 16:30 - Mike: Guy in my old wow guild had some insane hours, think we worked it out at 4 hours a day since the game has started. Somehow he was still shit.
17/06/2021, 16:30 - Mike: Had*
17/06/2021, 17:31 - Mike: Obesity genes
After university, Sarah started working in the pharmaceutical industry. She was performing well as a sales person, selling a diabetes drug. But she was taken aback after her boss told her that when he first met her he remembers thinking, "You better be a bloody good sales rep, looking the way you do, trying to sell a diabetes drug".

On an article about dieting on the BBC, what a lad saying it to her face.

19/06/2021, 10:46 - Lockers: Proved why people didn't want him on the first game

19/06/2021, 13:09 - Kirky: Permanent banned ?
19/06/2021, 13:12 - Wezz: It's a complex algorithm, most easily summarised as:
Ban duration inversely correlated to breast size

19/06/2021, 15:51 - Derren: Because this taking a knee stuff is bullshit
19/06/2021, 15:51 - Paul: Are you gonna march against it though
19/06/2021, 15:52 - Paul: Like at worst you should be indifferent to it
19/06/2021, 15:53 - Wezz: "They stated that decision was due to fears that the gesture was 'dividing more than uniting'."
19/06/2021, 15:53 - Wezz: Sorry, that's what the French team said prior to not taking a knee versus Germany
19/06/2021, 15:54 - Alex: Who is getting angry over players taking the knee though? I was thinking it had become pointless in the prem, but it didnt annoy me, it was just nothing, but now more than ever seems to just reinforce how needed it is
19/06/2021, 15:54 - Wezz: I'm just going to take a knee everywhere dude, I'm terrified. Started taking a knee at the self checkout for fear of being associated with the racists
19/06/2021, 15:54 - Wezz: I've reverted back to crawling everywhere
19/06/2021, 15:54 - Alex: If you are doing the crab everywhere you're racist
19/06/2021, 15:55 - Wezz: Sure, life's a bit more difficult. But we need to think about our racist predecessors.
19/06/2021, 15:55 - Paul: I don't think taking the knee does anything. But saying it actively divides us is pretty rich as the same crowd probably think it's a useless gesture
19/06/2021, 15:56 - Alex: It highlights the ignorant bigots, maybe makes the divide clearer, but that's not on people taking the inee
19/06/2021, 15:56 - Alex: *knee
19/06/2021, 15:57 - Paul: Yeah exposing people for being racist isn't a division problem lol that's totally on them for being racist
19/06/2021, 15:57 - Wezz: I think the danger is that it could fall into the same category as compelled speech. Compelled actions or public display of action. But in it's current state I see literally no problem with it. As Alex says; just outs the racists
19/06/2021, 15:58 - Paul: I can see an argument that it could reach a point where NOT taking a knee is considered racist. Which is probably part of their slippery slope argument. But yeah. Getting angry at a peaceful anti racist act is pretty telling of your stance
19/06/2021, 16:00 - Wezz: I think it also could set a precedent for celebrities to be all righteous, and that would mildly annoy me
19/06/2021, 16:01 - Paul: Yeah but they are already well annoying. Just look at all the faux activists for gay pride. Doesn't mean I'm marching
19/06/2021, 16:02 - Wezz: Totally, and it'll be the stupid ones that play that identity politics game before the smart ones.
19/06/2021, 16:02 - Lockers: Walking is for racists
19/06/2021, 16:02 - Paul: If someone at that match stops to tie their shoelace do they dog pile on them?
19/06/2021, 16:03 - Wezz: If I've got to see Louis Hambags do some 10-second public gesture to show he likes Siberian tigers before he drives his car fast I'll be upset.
19/06/2021, 16:03 - Wezz: Loool, GET HIM!
19/06/2021, 16:04 - Wezz: I've heard they all sleep on their backs, can't have the knees touch the ground
19/06/2021, 16:04 - Paul: Just in general since being allowed to post their own random thoughts on Twitter has become a thing a lot of the mystique of celebrities has broken down. Especially around Hollywood stars and musicians
19/06/2021, 16:05 - Paul: In 50 years it'll be all streamer personalities and less corporately manufactured celebs. Dunno if that's good
19/06/2021, 16:06 - Paul: Popularity has been slightly more democracised but that's why we get people like the Paul brothers
19/06/2021, 16:07 - Wezz: Yeah, the new wave of celebrities will be streamers, we're getting there already. I think *All Access*, behind the scenes-esk things are becoming more real. Harder to fake.
19/06/2021, 16:08 - Wezz: Plus current GEN are soft af, i mean we're soft too, but it's only gonna spiral until a war
19/06/2021, 16:08 - Paul: For sure. All the crazy shit rock stars used to do that became infamous with tvs out windows and groupies and drugs would be all over Instagram now and wouldn't be legendary it would ruin them lol
19/06/2021, 16:08 - Wezz: Then everyone dies cause nukes. Then gg no re
19/06/2021, 16:09 - Wezz: So weird, cause Paul bros started out as new age 'pranksters'. Now you get cancelled if you called someone a fag in 2001.
19/06/2021, 16:09 - Wezz: BRB, throwing my tv out the window
19/06/2021, 16:10 - Paul: People were massive fags back in 2001 tbf
19/06/2021, 16:11 - Wezz: I know loads of fags, at least three.

19/06/2021, 17:50 - Alex: Tbf both would have been goals anyway
19/06/2021, 17:51 - Lockers: Yeah pretty unavoidable

19/06/2021, 21:26 - James: I love your giraffe mask
19/06/2021, 21:27 - James: Damn, good spot Alex
19/06/2021, 21:30 - Wezz: I also directed the scene. I've since fired her for not capturing the panned HAPPY BIRTHDAY TAPAN.

She didn't have a giraffe mask..
19/06/2021, 21:30 - Wezz: Anyone around for GAMES? Or do I need to take a train to Tapans
19/06/2021, 21:34 - Kirky: Aww

19/06/2021, 23:26 - Wezz: Isn't he that dirty South American who plays for France?
19/06/2021, 23:28 - Piper: Yea
19/06/2021, 23:28 - Piper: Loser from South America  who dives a lot.. didn't play today
19/06/2021, 23:29 - Wezz: probably found a SWIMMING POOL so he could practice his DIVES

19/06/2021, 23:35 - Wezz: No, what do they say?
19/06/2021, 23:37 - Wezz: Ah you lost me, I'm still trying to figure out what they say
19/06/2021, 23:37 - Lockers: That's because you've had your first beer
19/06/2021, 23:38 - Wezz: Ahhh you know what they say about that!
19/06/2021, 23:39 - Piper: Divers will always üêù  south American
19/06/2021, 23:39 - Mike: Imagine thinking "I remember my first beer" was funny
19/06/2021, 23:40 - Lockers: Haha bee
19/06/2021, 23:40 - Lockers: You wanna go?
19/06/2021, 23:41 - Wezz: You remember what they say about people who find things funny though...
19/06/2021, 23:47 - Wezz: Aww dude I just had a great video clip. Fuuuuuuuck. Scottish guy singing "I can boogie" in the rain. Start joining in and a car goes past yelling FUCK SCOTLAND. Shouted fuck England back with passion. BYE VIDEO rain said no
20/06/2021, 00:16 - James: Sorry dude, Alex and I are playing Minecraft like a couple of cool kids, I need reservations of my time to be made in advance
20/06/2021, 07:55 - Paul: This is way too cryptic
20/06/2021, 08:46 - Wezz: _what does it mean?_
20/06/2021, 08:47 - Paul: If you had a separate pile for each of every type of animal you've seen in your life (in person), which pile do you think would be the biggest?
20/06/2021, 09:03 - Wezz: Man, that's a tough question. I've been to loads of zoos. So immediately could stack up 10 x üêò. But surely something like 10,000,000 xü™∞ would compete? And if we're grouping all breeds of üê∂ together that's a probable winner. Notable mention is something like üïäÔ∏è, see huge flocks of those. Don't know how many are the same though, assuming we're only counting uniques.

Dayles the biggest animal I've seen, but I don't think that was the question.
20/06/2021, 09:05 - Paul: I was definitely thinking seagull or pigeon is gonna be one of the biggest. Definitely seen a lot of humans too though. At festivals and looking off high balconies etc
20/06/2021, 09:06 - Paul: I just don't think flies have enough volume to compete
20/06/2021, 09:07 - Paul: Even if I've seen 100 elephants in my life which I very much doubt I think it's not enough
20/06/2021, 09:09 - Paul: Seen a lot of fish too now that I think about it. So maybe would depend how we group that taxonomy
20/06/2021, 09:12 - Paul: Gotta be over a million humans I've seen though?
20/06/2021, 09:22 - Wezz: Humans win hands down, I assumed we excluded them.
20/06/2021, 09:25 - Wezz: üêü are a really interesting one. Do they have to be alive and swimming? Been to a few üéè markets where they're semi alive and not swimming.. how about a skin on ü¶É at the supermarket? Do üê≥üêã count as üê†?
20/06/2021, 09:27 - Paul: I thought there's a solid chance I've seen more birds than humans
20/06/2021, 09:30 - Wezz: In number or volume?
20/06/2021, 09:31 - Paul: Hard to say. Probably 50 birds to a person?
20/06/2021, 09:31 - Paul: Bit less?
20/06/2021, 09:31 - Wezz: I quickly thought about üêú. But then googled you'd need to see six billion üêú per elephant
20/06/2021, 09:31 - Wezz: Sorry this was weight, didn't mean to misinform
20/06/2021, 09:34 - Wezz: Greatly dependant on the bird and human, I'd agree 50x ü¶ú to a human. But maybe as few as 10x ü¶Ö to a human?
20/06/2021, 09:34 - Wezz: 1x üë∂ = 1x ü¶Ü?
20/06/2021, 12:10 - Piper: some league? @447561062944 @447943624891 @447306561498

20/06/2021, 15:45 - Wezz: The calm before the storm. Literally 2 seconds later I take the foil off the Frostino‚Ñ¢Ô∏è and then knocked it over with my elbow mid game.
20/06/2021, 15:45 - Wezz: No Frostino.
20/06/2021, 15:46 - Wezz: All over my legs, mouse mat, tower, floor. Frostino life

20/06/2021, 15:49 - Wezz: Distraught.
20/06/2021, 16:02 - Qck: Pretty sure you deserved it after posting a serial killer photo of your coffee and pretending it had the legs to make it to insta
20/06/2021, 16:08 - Wezz: I don't need your bullshit right now üòî
20/06/2021, 16:53 - Qck: You're right, I'm sorry for your loss
20/06/2021, 16:53 - Paul: And the sheer audacity to think it was good enough viewing material so soon after the ducks
20/06/2021, 16:53 - Qck: Wait take that back I've got a friend

20/06/2021, 19:29 - Qck: I mean yellow facing is just as bad and yet the yellow m&m is the face of the franchise
20/06/2021, 19:30 - Qck: I'd still fuck the brown m&m
20/06/2021, 21:11 - Lee: This is fucking so sad.
20/06/2021, 21:22 - Paul: Just watched The Joker, Wezz you were right that was fucking awesome
20/06/2021, 22:09 - Wezz: Thanks. Few hours have passed. My room smells of Frostino. My carpet is sticky. Probably get ants.
20/06/2021, 22:10 - Wezz: Paid 6¬£ for this

20/06/2021, 22:12 - Wezz: Great movie. Voice for some voiceless individuals. Still surprised it didn't spawn a cult.
20/06/2021, 22:13 - Wezz: Thought it was some M&M sponsored crack pipe in her hand. Instead it's glare and she's a cannibal. Okay; _i guess_.

*sigh*
20/06/2021, 22:46 - Derren: Where's some new content mate
20/06/2021, 22:46 - Wezz: Sorry... I'm two years in the past
21/06/2021, 01:13 - Mike: What in the vajazzle

Bye PCM
21/06/2021, 11:02 - Paul: Sub was really 50/50 good memes and then people taking stuff way too literally
21/06/2021, 11:03 - Paul: Also overused based so much that it became meaningless. But I guess that was kinda part of the joke
21/06/2021, 11:20 - Paul: <Media omitted>
21/06/2021, 11:56 - Derren: @447835575116 https://youtu.be/zJNTh_Ygn50?t=358 here's a condensed version of that hax$ video
21/06/2021, 12:40 - Mike: "condensed"
21/06/2021, 12:40 - Mike: Fucking sperge isms
21/06/2021, 12:40 - Derren: Original vid was 2 1/2 hours
21/06/2021, 12:44 - Mike: felt like 4 years
21/06/2021, 12:45 - Derren: Why did you watch it üòÇ
21/06/2021, 12:47 - Mike: I feel like a father whos out of touch with his kids, I try my hardest now and then but I just can't connect with my disabled children. Instead I turn to the bottle, cursing my wife who no longer cares for me and my God who does the same.
21/06/2021, 12:48 - Mike: Every night I load that gun and every early morning when I wake from my drunken stupor I unload and hide it before the family get up. I'll do it all again tomorrow, silently sobbing over the trigger I can never muster the courage to pull.
21/06/2021, 12:48 - Derren: There's better ways than the bottle mike
21/06/2021, 13:10 - Paul: Heroin?
21/06/2021, 13:36 - Alex: Is this because Paul tried to kill you in dnd....?

21/06/2021, 13:44 - Wezz: Lend me your gun? üî´
21/06/2021, 14:30 - Derren: She has a whatsapp group identical to this but with women it seems
21/06/2021, 14:31 - James: A real clam fest
21/06/2021, 15:17 - Noone: Is there any way to reverse sending a girl ¬£340 if she never sent you the videos of her armpits she promised? I'm asking for a friend
21/06/2021, 15:22 - Wezz: Yes. Send me your armpits and I'll reverse the charge sir
21/06/2021, 15:22 - Derren: depends how you sent it, you can reverse charge on paypal or go through your bank
21/06/2021, 15:29 - Mike: Users of apps
21/06/2021, 15:29 - Mike: how do apps show something as "swipeable"?
21/06/2021, 15:30 - Mike: <Media omitted>
21/06/2021, 15:30 - Mike: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jshanson7/react-native-swipeable/master/example/example.android.gif *
21/06/2021, 15:34 - Mike: I'll do it for half price
21/06/2021, 15:37 - Wezz: I just swipe on it and hope.
21/06/2021, 15:37 - Wezz: Usually indicate it can be swiped with some >>>> arrows
21/06/2021, 15:37 - Wezz: ?
21/06/2021, 15:38 - Wezz: I love the animations though. Last one is simple boolean swipey
21/06/2021, 15:40 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
21/06/2021, 15:42 - Mike: Its in a list like the above gif so don't think the dots work as you say
21/06/2021, 15:43 - Kirky: <Media omitted>
21/06/2021, 15:43 - Mike: could work, thanks
21/06/2021, 16:07 - Kirky: <Media omitted>
21/06/2021, 16:17 - Paul: Maybe when you press your thumb on it it could pulse and slightly slide to the right
21/06/2021, 16:28 - Qck: speaking from experience?
21/06/2021, 16:28 - Derren: Always
21/06/2021, 16:29 - Derren: Would be even funnier if that was his mate
21/06/2021, 16:41 - Wezz: You'd like that wouldn't you
21/06/2021, 16:57 - Paul: Well you know what they say
21/06/2021, 17:11 - Paul: M√ºller injured ‚òπÔ∏è
21/06/2021, 17:22 - James: <Media omitted>
21/06/2021, 17:22 - James: So in the above example you see the purple edge that will be the purple swipe action when pulled
21/06/2021, 17:23 - James: Alternatively, you could use some pendo style tutorials where it tells you what the actions for swiping do the first time you access the screen.
21/06/2021, 17:28 - Wezz: I like this and James picture. Stick the arrows and "touch to swipe" first time it loads. Then just let em figure the vertical bar on right side = swipe
21/06/2021, 18:29 - Kirky: <Media omitted>
21/06/2021, 18:42 - Mike: Probably makes the most sense, if I could get it not to crash the phone when swiping that'd be a great start
21/06/2021, 21:25 - Noone: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_ogzbodL2I important for Paul

22/06/2021, 08:32 - James: Boris is going to be very upset, you guaranteed him big money on this
22/06/2021, 08:33 - Paul: Yes I'm deliberately doing terribly in last place to feed him
22/06/2021, 09:27 - Wezz: Is it like WC3 Vampirism?
22/06/2021, 09:46 - Mike: Good to see my boys are doing well
22/06/2021, 09:51 - Paul: I'm just making everyone else overconfident so I can sneak in at the end and win it all
22/06/2021, 10:07 - Alex: Seeing the beans up at 5 warms my heart ü•≤
22/06/2021, 10:48 - James: I should have made my team called Toast, so either I would have beat you, or you would have been half of my Beans on Toast

22/06/2021, 14:02 - Lee: What are the lyrics to the song Fish by Tyler The Creator?
22/06/2021, 14:02 - Wezz: Slip it in her drink and in the blink
Of an eye I can make a white girl look chink
Don't know what to think, cause last time
I attempted this shit the judge ordered me to see a shrink
22/06/2021, 14:03 - Wezz: Well, there you go

22/06/2021, 14:04 - Kirky: Line about a Japanese girl
22/06/2021, 14:04 - Kirky: "Is it racist if I say she tastes like edemame?"
22/06/2021, 14:04 - Wezz: I mean, he's date raping a white girl.
22/06/2021, 14:05 - Wezz: It's all a bit too edgy for me
22/06/2021, 14:06 - Alex: "I'm gonna write a song about date raping someone, but it might not be offensive enough so I'm gonna stick in a racist remark while I'm at it...."
22/06/2021, 14:07 - Qck: What is this 2012 why are we talking about old Tyler the Creator lyrics
22/06/2021, 14:07 - Qck: Theresa May can't ban him again can she
22/06/2021, 14:07 - Kirky: Cause he a racist rapist and getting cancelled by the bummers

22/06/2021, 14:26 - James: Back in your day it was women doing maths and showing their ankles that was considered offensive
22/06/2021, 14:27 - Paul: And we were better off for it I say
22/06/2021, 14:27 - Paul: Ever since we've given women a voice it's all gone down hill
22/06/2021, 14:30 - Kirky: THANK GOD I can back to losing league gold was getting far too comfortable
22/06/2021, 14:37 - Paul: UEFA have refused Germany permission to show rainbow colours as a protest against Hungary. I hope they do it anyway
22/06/2021, 14:37 - Paul: When I say Germany I mean city of Munich and Allianz stadium
22/06/2021, 14:38 - James: Be the change you want to see in the world Paul, go out wearing your rainbows and storm the pitch
22/06/2021, 14:39 - Wezz: Yeah, Islam has always been right about women.

22/06/2021, 15:25 - Wezz: What garden is that? Gotta be the Queen's, or the public's?
22/06/2021, 15:36 - Kirky: yea he took that from the queens bedroom window
22/06/2021, 15:41 - Qck: Hampton Court which quite rightly takes up a space in the Queen's real estate portfolio
22/06/2021, 15:44 - Qck: She got it at a great price

shit is closed to the public atm so I'm thinking I should start looking for the secret toilet reserved for royalty just so I can take a giant republic turd made from the people's bread
22/06/2021, 15:45 - Paul: Was pretty cool of them to style metroid aliens into the grass
22/06/2021, 15:47 - James: The Queen was the original gamer e-girl
22/06/2021, 17:35 - Wezz: Perfect time for it as she'll be knackered from wearing hats and watching the horses get whipped at Ascot.
22/06/2021, 18:58 - Paul: Predictions for tonight?
22/06/2021, 18:58 - Kirky: 5-0
22/06/2021, 19:01 - Wezz: So without COVID boi Mount in, he best start Grealish. If he starts Grealish we win 3-0, prob get a penalty or two too.
22/06/2021, 19:04 - Piper: You fancy grealish or summing samboi
22/06/2021, 19:06 - Wezz: Lovely locks
22/06/2021, 19:08 - Wezz: Ah, ITV means no Lineker right?

22/06/2021, 19:10 - Piper: <Media omitted>
22/06/2021, 19:11 - Wezz: Feel good about that. After Friday needed a mix-up. Grealish specifically a playmaker that I think will open things up, earn some fouls.
22/06/2021, 19:11 - Wezz: HYPE
22/06/2021, 19:11 - Lockers: Do you know saka?
22/06/2021, 19:12 - Lockers: Joke he or Rashford aren't playing
22/06/2021, 19:14 - Wezz: Yeah, doesn't he play quarterback? or caddie for Tiger Woods?
22/06/2021, 19:18 - Paul: Fucking finally.
22/06/2021, 19:18 - Paul: Can't believe making the bench is an achievement at this point. Southgate is a right wanker

22/06/2021, 20:14 - Paul: Where was this energy vs Scotland
22/06/2021, 20:15 - Kirky: not technically foreign so no need to go so hard on them
22/06/2021, 20:15 - Paul: They sound pretty foreign to me
22/06/2021, 20:15 - Kirky: yea they look it too
22/06/2021, 20:15 - Kirky: ginger fucks
22/06/2021, 20:16 - Paul: ü•≤ haha yea right

22/06/2021, 21:26 - Paul: Mate if rashford scores after I transferred him I'm kicking off
22/06/2021, 21:27 - Paul: So far everyone I've transferred has scored like 20 points in their next game
22/06/2021, 21:38 - Kirky: <Media omitted>
22/06/2021, 21:42 - Paul: SANCHOOOO
22/06/2021, 21:42 - Wezz: Do you even get a point?
22/06/2021, 21:42 - Paul: Yeah 1
22/06/2021, 21:43 - Wezz: I transfered grealish cause he got zero play time. then they start him today. SWEET
22/06/2021, 21:43 - Paul: 10m 3 games 1 point so far
22/06/2021, 21:47 - Paul: Alex what's this limitless thing you've done and how do I do it
22/06/2021, 21:48 - Alex: Gotta be good at the hacks
22/06/2021, 21:48 - Alex: Between matchdays it's an option at the top to activate it
22/06/2021, 21:48 - Alex: So for this matchday only I had unlimited transfers with unlimited budget, and then next matchday it will revert
22/06/2021, 21:49 - Paul: Wtf
22/06/2021, 21:49 - Paul: Unlimited transfers???
22/06/2021, 21:50 - Lockers: Yes after group stage
22/06/2021, 21:51 - Paul: I'm gonna get 11 sanchos
22/06/2021, 21:51 - Wezz: Hacks

22/06/2021, 21:58 - Dayle: HI IM DUMB :D
22/06/2021, 23:27 - Wezz: Did you D&D guys see the Skill Up review of Dark Alliance ?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIEOF-Aa1Rk
22/06/2021, 23:29 - Mike: I'll take a watch, think I remember watching the trailer and thinking "this is about as DnD as my nan"
22/06/2021, 23:32 - Wezz: Yeah, can't quite tell if the guy is just a moaner. But doesn't seem _great_.
22/06/2021, 23:34 - Mike: Looks like some no name studio got the rights from wizards from the coast somehow, bonkers
22/06/2021, 23:35 - Mike: Scratch that, wizard of the coast bought Tuque studio and had them create this game. Oopsie

23/06/2021, 08:11 - Piper: well i won!
23/06/2021, 08:26 - Wezz: That means you up from the whole deal right? _nice_
23/06/2021, 08:44 - Piper: well a 5er ;D
23/06/2021, 08:44 - Piper: still got 1 more free bet
23/06/2021, 08:45 - Piper: apparently i didnt do the bets right so had to add another 30 to get the free bets

23/06/2021, 09:17 - Paul: Spain are gonna win 8-0
23/06/2021, 09:22 - Piper: most likely
23/06/2021, 09:23 - Wezz: Jesus. 15.00 for Slovakia. Possibly biggest underdog the whole tournament?
23/06/2021, 09:23 - Paul: No that's France
23/06/2021, 09:23 - Wezz: Inb4 Slovakia win but SWE v POL draw
23/06/2021, 09:49 - Dayle: Italy to win it all - 1000 hours played without conceding a single goal i heard.
23/06/2021, 09:52 - Dayle: Mins** fucking hours that insane.
23/06/2021, 10:14 - Lockers: Imagine playing a game for 1000 hours lol nerds
23/06/2021, 10:17 - Wezz: Anyone wanna open a McDonald's franchise and run it together? I'm stressed and wanna flip burgers for a month
23/06/2021, 10:18 - Wezz: Do you even flip burgers at a McDonald's?
23/06/2021, 10:18 - Dayle: No you don't, its strongly advised not to actually flip the patties
23/06/2021, 10:24 - James: You actually just pick up the patties and then flip yourself
23/06/2021, 10:30 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
23/06/2021, 10:50 - Noone: bi weekly reminder that Derren spells his name wrong

23/06/2021, 11:00 - James: Some of us work Paul, we can't all be here to distract you from your intrusive thoughts with our witty banter all the time
23/06/2021, 11:01 - Alex: I'm not working at the moment, but I dont think paul deserves my witty banter right now
23/06/2021, 11:01 - Wezz: I'm just scared of Dayle
23/06/2021, 11:01 - James: You're scared of everything dude
23/06/2021, 11:02 - James: Just wandering around periodically screaming
23/06/2021, 11:03 - Wezz: Life's scary man. How are we all here?
23/06/2021, 11:03 - Wezz: Ahhhh
23/06/2021, 11:03 - Wezz: Stop triggering me
23/06/2021, 11:04 - Paul: The sun is hot and the moon is cold, coincidence?
23/06/2021, 11:04 - James: Life as we know it is a house of cards Sam, everything and anything could destroy our very way of life at any moment and we're all helpless to do anything about it
23/06/2021, 11:04 - Wezz: ... I actually feel a lot better. Thanks
23/06/2021, 11:05 - James: I think it really justifies shots in chat when you think about it like that
23/06/2021, 11:10 - Wezz: Existentialism was really getting me down. Much prefer this helplessness approach, just floating about in space. #borisoutjamesin
23/06/2021, 11:32 - Paul: What is space though? Why is it there?
23/06/2021, 11:32 - James: There for aesthetics
23/06/2021, 11:44 - Wezz: Life without space would be cramped
23/06/2021, 11:45 - James: and where would you store things?
23/06/2021, 11:45 - Paul: In the cupboard
23/06/2021, 11:45 - James: but there would be no space in the cupboard
23/06/2021, 11:47 - Paul: Fine, then the wardrobe
23/06/2021, 11:50 - Wezz: I'd use my freezer for things it wasn't made for
23/06/2021, 11:54 - James: Out of luck on both counts, no space in the wardrobe or freezer
23/06/2021, 12:02 - Paul: This is quite the conundrum
23/06/2021, 12:04 - Nathan: I'd store my extra items inside a grandfather clock. Time is key when there is no space
23/06/2021, 12:06 - Dayle: I would buy a space and store things in that
23/06/2021, 12:19 - Wezz: In a life without space, how expensive would space be? Infinite?
23/06/2021, 12:20 - Qck: I'd cover myself in cryoprotectants, step inside of a prism and become one with both time and space, see the blood moon rise, galaxies devastated and rebirthed anew, life itself becomes embryonic and my anus will loosen in expectance of final entropy

And that's the moment when my keys and my wallet and all my other things will fall out of my gaping asshole as it's where I keep my stuff
23/06/2021, 12:20 - Wezz: Filling space with time, such a northerner
23/06/2021, 12:23 - Wezz: Holy shit. The anomaly of the space time continuum..the black hole of spaceless life..QCK's asshole.
23/06/2021, 12:23 - Paul: Does this work James?
23/06/2021, 12:26 - James: The maths does check out, I'm impressed at how prepared he was for this hypothetical, someone has thought about this before.
23/06/2021, 12:26 - James: 10 points to Qwikkendor
23/06/2021, 12:27 - Qck: It relies heavily on Einstein's theory of the infinite rectum which could still be debunked
23/06/2021, 12:27 - James: Did you compensate for carrying the one?
23/06/2021, 12:30 - Paul: Oh shit, he fucking didn't HAHAHAHA, got 'em
23/06/2021, 12:30 - Paul: Mate he thought he was well smart
23/06/2021, 12:32 - Qck: Aim_IQTest 1v1 or scared
23/06/2021, 12:33 - Paul: Let's do a Raven's Matrices IQ Test
23/06/2021, 12:34 - Qck: Is that a CS map?
23/06/2021, 12:34 - Paul: https://psycho-tests.com/test/raven-matrixes-test
23/06/2021, 12:35 - Derren: Are you upset that your IQ was lower than mine on the Mensa website
23/06/2021, 12:35 - Qck: I take my IQ tests only via counter-strike community maps
23/06/2021, 12:35 - Derren: üòÇ
23/06/2021, 12:35 - Qck: Never heard this one before, that's hilarious
23/06/2021, 12:36 - Qck: I guess when Paul earns his doctorate you're more of a doctor than him
23/06/2021, 12:36 - Qck: Dr. Derek and Junior Dr. Fish
23/06/2021, 12:37 - Derren: iirc a lot of people here did the test and all scored lower than I did
23/06/2021, 12:37 - Derren: <Media omitted>
23/06/2021, 12:37 - Qck: I mean you're gonna be recalling correctly aren't you? This is a big win for you
23/06/2021, 12:38 - Derren: It was just funnier how upset they were and the excuses they used
23/06/2021, 12:38 - Derren: The result is meaningless to me
23/06/2021, 12:38 - Qck: Doubt. Never heard an excuse out of Paul before...
23/06/2021, 12:45 - Noone: jesus christ nobody remembers this, only you
23/06/2021, 12:47 - Derren: <Media omitted>
23/06/2021, 12:49 - James: Everyone is just mad that Derren has the big brains
23/06/2021, 12:51 - Kirky: You accused us of being mad cause we are all racist and cant believe a turk has  a higher IQ than us
23/06/2021, 12:53 - Paul: lmao christ
23/06/2021, 12:53 - Noone: Derren if you had an IQ above 45 you wouldn't be playing an MMO with -4 players
23/06/2021, 12:54 - Derren: See what I mean Sam, the hostile energy remains years later
23/06/2021, 12:54 - Noone: shut up muslim boy
23/06/2021, 12:54 - Qck: Haha you're not wrong, seems to be a sore subject for these smoothbrains
23/06/2021, 12:55 - Qck: That's RE: Derren
not RE: shut up muslim boy
23/06/2021, 12:56 - Noone: you can shut up too, muslim boy
23/06/2021, 12:56 - James: Oh dear, he can't think of more than one insult, that's brought down his IQ score
23/06/2021, 12:57 - Noone: sh- sHUT UP MUSLIM BOY
23/06/2021, 12:57 - Derren: <Media omitted>
23/06/2021, 12:58 - Noone: Nice guys we gave him that win, you said he was having a hard time recently? Glad we could help him.
23/06/2021, 12:58 - Noone: shit, wrong chat
23/06/2021, 12:58 - Wezz: DELETE IT JAMES QUICK
23/06/2021, 12:58 - Qck: Yeah James
23/06/2021, 12:58 - Paul: I like to think you can deplete IQ by doing strenuous things and it never recovers
23/06/2021, 12:59 - Qck: No wonder Julia is a retard then
23/06/2021, 12:59 - James: Damn, that's a lot of damage
23/06/2021, 13:00 - Paul: Mate don't make her get the nazi boys
23/06/2021, 13:00 - Qck: In fairness I'm implying that Julia actually has sex with Paul so he'll still see it as complimentary
23/06/2021, 13:14 - Mike: <Media omitted>
23/06/2021, 13:15 - Derren: At this point surely you'd just make the gender box "Type whatever you want" and have it accept it
23/06/2021, 13:15 - Kirky: <Media omitted>
23/06/2021, 13:16 - Mike: yeh but then you'd get 'male', 'MALE', 'Man', 'Straight', ' MEN'
23/06/2021, 13:16 - James: You are a reporting consultants worst nightmare
23/06/2021, 13:17 - Mike: I literally lost 15 minutes of my life because someone entered in a Nando's restaurant name as ' Stratford' with the leading space the other day
23/06/2021, 13:18 - Qck: Kirky's a dietary consultants worst nightmare
23/06/2021, 13:20 - James: I'm currently at Str…ëtford
23/06/2021, 13:21 - James: How does your chicken app deal with that Mike?
23/06/2021, 13:21 - Kirky: How close is that to  Stratford?
23/06/2021, 13:21 - James: Pretty close, about a single space's distance
23/06/2021, 13:21 - Kirky: Closer than Stratford?
23/06/2021, 13:21 - James: Closer than you'd think
23/06/2021, 13:46 - Derren: <Media omitted>
23/06/2021, 13:48 - Qck: doesn't take 120 brain points to edit the source code

23/06/2021, 13:49 - Kirky: IDIOT TURK HAHAHHA
23/06/2021, 13:50 - Qck: psycho-tests.com?
23/06/2021, 13:50 - Qck: And we're supposed to be surprised you scored well on the psycho test?!
23/06/2021, 13:50 - Derren: Paul linked it, blame him
23/06/2021, 13:53 - Qck: Alright I will
23/06/2021, 13:54 - Qck: <Media omitted>
23/06/2021, 14:03 - Noone: .trim(0
23/06/2021, 14:30 - Paul: I got 128, but in fairness I teach this test as part of my course
23/06/2021, 14:30 - Paul: (the scores mean fuck all without the norm data)
23/06/2021, 14:31 - Derren: I dunno what that means xD
23/06/2021, 14:31 - Derren: The last questions on E I have no fucking clue
23/06/2021, 14:31 - Paul: That's literally an example one that I use on my course of a really hard one lol
23/06/2021, 14:32 - Paul: <Media omitted>
23/06/2021, 14:32 - Paul: oh, its warped all shitty on whatsapp
23/06/2021, 14:33 - Paul: Welcome to come audit my class m8, i'll give you course credits
23/06/2021, 14:35 - Mike: Hmmm yes, shallow and pedantic
23/06/2021, 14:36 - Qck: Is it dickbutt
23/06/2021, 14:49 - Wezz: I guess 3. Something about individual shapes intersecting?
23/06/2021, 14:52 - James: <Media omitted>
23/06/2021, 14:52 - Paul: I have an answer, which was found by a student, it makes logical sense so I think it's right, but I don't have the manual for this to confirm.
23/06/2021, 14:53 - Paul: So if you wanna know I can post it
23/06/2021, 14:54 - James: 5, I think it's the amount of times the lines intersect represented by the number of dots
23/06/2021, 14:54 - Paul: Bingo, well done
23/06/2021, 14:55 - Wezz: Man, you're so smart
23/06/2021, 14:56 - James: Thanks Sam, meaningless ego boosters like this are what I live for
23/06/2021, 14:57 - Paul: Yeah but who's got the most teeth?
23/06/2021, 14:57 - Kirky: not misto thats for sure
23/06/2021, 14:58 - Wezz: I've had one taken out, but I have all my wisdom teeth. And a secret tooth somewhere special üçÜ
23/06/2021, 14:58 - Paul: Didn't you once tell me a story about a tooth in someones eye or something
23/06/2021, 14:59 - Paul: I just googled it: Osteo-odonto-keratoprosthesis, ah that old classic
23/06/2021, 14:59 - Kirky: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0780622/ ?
23/06/2021, 15:00 - Wezz: ü¶∑ü¶∑ü¶∑ü¶∑ü¶∑
23/06/2021, 15:00 - Paul: I think I've had 4 extractions total, wasn't fun
23/06/2021, 15:01 - Wezz: But you told me the 1 trick that dentists hate
23/06/2021, 16:19 - Derren: You got the same as me üò≥
23/06/2021, 16:20 - James: We're smart bois Derren
23/06/2021, 16:20 - Dayle: Where is that iq test boys? I'ma complete it
23/06/2021, 16:21 - James: @447429507368
23/06/2021, 16:26 - Alex: <Media omitted>
23/06/2021, 16:26 - James: Dude, I'm pretty sure 2 is way lower that 122
23/06/2021, 16:26 - James: than*
23/06/2021, 16:28 - Alex: The fact you had to correct a mistake shows you are way lower than me
23/06/2021, 16:32 - James: Real intelligence comes from recognising and correcting your own mistakes young one.

It is not the man that doesn't commit suicide over a maths problem that is truly smart, it is the man that commits suicide and gets back up again.
23/06/2021, 16:32 - Alex: So you have committed suicide over that mistake? If not, kill yourself
23/06/2021, 16:33 - James: 3 times already
23/06/2021, 16:33 - James: I've killed myself more days than you've been alive
23/06/2021, 16:34 - Wezz: Oh, so all of a sudden now you know what they say.
23/06/2021, 16:35 - James: I knew what they said from day one Samsonian, I always supported your search for what they say, it is a noble quest
23/06/2021, 16:36 - Wezz: Glad someone knows what they say
23/06/2021, 16:39 - Wezz: You know what they say...
23/06/2021, 16:39 - Wezz: Nobility is what is earned by those who have no other earnings.
23/06/2021, 16:41 - Wezz: @447429507368, you know what they say..
23/06/2021, 16:41 - Dayle: shots in chat?
23/06/2021, 16:43 - Wezz: Everyone's so wise this afternoon. Pleased with your amity
23/06/2021, 16:47 - Dayle: <Media omitted>

23/06/2021, 17:38 - Nathan: 1 shot for every IQ point above 100... thick and sober or intelligent and drunk! You decide
23/06/2021, 17:41 - Derren: I got 128 iq on the test I linked I've become dumber ü•∫
23/06/2021, 17:44 - Wezz: The psychologists have termed this; the Aion Affect.
23/06/2021, 17:44 - Derren: üò™
23/06/2021, 17:44 - Wezz: (https://www.grammarly.com/blog/affect-vs-effect/)
23/06/2021, 17:45 - Wezz: You smart son. I never take part in these dick measuring contests. Therefore I can always claim I have the biggest dick
23/06/2021, 19:37 - Wezz: https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=%22Nazi%20Germany%22&src=trend_click&vertical=trends

Nazi Germany currently trending on Twitter...people comparing the UK to Nazi Germany.

For real. LOL
23/06/2021, 19:50 - Paul: I don't really get why round 3 has so many games at the same time. It wasn't like that for the first 2 rounds was it?
23/06/2021, 20:15 - Lockers: To avoid fixtures potentially effecting one another
23/06/2021, 20:16 - Paul: Oh right yeah makes sense
23/06/2021, 20:16 - Paul: Also lol Germany
23/06/2021, 20:24 - Wezz: Hungary making plays. Stays like this Germany are out üëÄ
23/06/2021, 20:39 - Paul: What scenario keeps them in? Do they need to win or just draw?
23/06/2021, 20:40 - Lockers: Draw
23/06/2021, 20:41 - Paul: Regardless of the other game?
23/06/2021, 20:41 - Lockers: They need to finish third with 4 points afaik
23/06/2021, 20:41 - Lockers: Dunno how secure that is
23/06/2021, 20:42 - Paul: Wait 3rd place stays in?
23/06/2021, 20:43 - Lockers: Third places go into like a mini third place league and best third place goes through
23/06/2021, 20:43 - Lockers: Depending on who they can play
23/06/2021, 20:43 - Lockers: Tbh, I find that bit v confusing and need to see it in action
23/06/2021, 20:44 - Paul: How does that work then? That leaves 18 teams for the ro16
23/06/2021, 20:44 - Paul: Oh I see.
23/06/2021, 20:44 - Lockers: Read all messages dude
23/06/2021, 20:44 - Paul: It hadn't loaded sorry
23/06/2021, 20:49 - Lockers: What is this 2003
23/06/2021, 20:53 - Qck: 3 separate german government agencies have to o.k. the messages you send to paul, can cause beaurocratic lag or b√´ar√∂l√§g as the Germans affectionately call it
23/06/2021, 20:54 - Wezz: All fart no poo
23/06/2021, 20:56 - Qck: <Media omitted>
23/06/2021, 21:00 - Wezz: Most of one is certainly less than one, heard it from the horse's mouth. Holocaust was a hoax.
23/06/2021, 21:03 - Qck: Haha, yeah, half of my granddad was gassed...
Luckily it was the bottom half... and luckily it wasn't zyklon b but my grandma... she would queef on him in full Nazi regalia

23/06/2021, 21:22 - Qck: God dang RIP but that dude was absolutely on one for the last ten years
23/06/2021, 21:23 - Paul: Didn't he get a prostitute to shit through a hammock onto his face or was I trolled
23/06/2021, 21:23 - Lockers: That was you dude. They shit on your face
23/06/2021, 21:23 - Qck: I think if you're a tech billionaire that's par for the course
23/06/2021, 21:23 - Paul: Haha true that was top laughs
23/06/2021, 21:27 - Paul: Fucking LOL
23/06/2021, 21:28 - Lockers: GERMANY LOL
23/06/2021, 21:28 - Paul: Mate they got to celebrate for like 20 seconds
23/06/2021, 21:44 - Qck: Gat damn Germany
23/06/2021, 21:53 - Paul: That means England vs Germany right?
23/06/2021, 21:56 - Qck: Yarp
23/06/2021, 22:48 - Paul: Belgium top their group and get to play Portugal. Denmark get 3 points and get to play Wales. Seems fair üòÖ
23/06/2021, 23:39 - Noone: tell me about it
23/06/2021, 23:42 - Lockers: Well... Belgium topped their group by winning all their games and get to play Portugal, who are rather good. Denmark get through with a lucky 3 points and get to play Wales who aren't anywhere near as good. Paul's "seems fair" is sarcastic
24/06/2021, 00:14 - Qck: now do it in french
24/06/2021, 06:50 - Lockers: Oui
24/06/2021, 07:00 - Kirky: Cant believe French has a word for that
24/06/2021, 07:01 - Alex: Theres a reason people call the language "the german of the romance languages"
24/06/2021, 08:29 - Wezz: Had a chuckle, high praise considering it's a workday morning
24/06/2021, 10:26 - Kirky: I've got a Queens birthday card to deliver today
24/06/2021, 10:27 - Kirky: For someones 100th birthday
24/06/2021, 10:28 - Wezz: Fart on it
24/06/2021, 10:30 - Paul: I thought they didnt do that anymore
24/06/2021, 10:33 - Noone: that's pretty cool
24/06/2021, 11:03 - Kirky: No it's not I'm expecting be all ooo happy birthday card from the queen thats cool bet youve got some story's to tell blah blah blah
24/06/2021, 11:03 - Kirky: When really I just want to run around and go home asap and talk to nobody
24/06/2021, 11:03 - Kirky: Wouldnt have this issue if covid could do its job
24/06/2021, 11:04 - Noone: Be kind to the old people, they're the last ones who are allowed to be racist
24/06/2021, 11:05 - Kirky: Sooner you're voted into power the better
24/06/2021, 11:12 - Paul: You guys remember I mentioned that conspiracy about Britney Spears and her instagram page last year? Turns out it was all true. Audio of her court case today was leaked where she explains how she has been forced onto drugs (Lithium), has no control over her own finances, is forced to work, and is being refused the right to remove her IUD and have children. All by her conservators (who she pays) and her Father. Who she now wants to sue and calls evil. She also talks about how her previous doctor abused her. Pretty fucked up. She was also barred from talking about it publically by her court-appointed lawyer. So lucky it was leaked
24/06/2021, 11:15 - Nathan: Do you have to do a special dance & song as well?
24/06/2021, 11:24 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
24/06/2021, 11:26 - Wezz: She would say that, apt she has a song called "(you drive me) Crazy"
24/06/2021, 11:27 - Paul: So many of her songs are oddly prophetic. Overprotected, Lucky
24/06/2021, 11:28 - Wezz: Obv J/K, but this a high profile case of something that for sure happens. She has a fanbase that'll free her into a messed up celeb life.
24/06/2021, 11:29 - Paul: Yeah it reminded me of that movie I Care A Lot
24/06/2021, 11:29 - Wezz: The others don't have that. Wasn't there a study done where psychologists self admitted to mental institutes then struggled to get out?
24/06/2021, 11:30 - Paul: Yeah I seem to remember there being a documentary about this
24/06/2021, 11:30 - Wezz: Not seen that, looks cool! Going on my watch list
24/06/2021, 11:31 - Paul: Conservatorships not even once: doing bad = see you need this, doing well = see its working
24/06/2021, 11:31 - Qck: Pretty crazy she's not even allowed to hire a lawyer
24/06/2021, 11:31 - Wezz: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenhan_experiment
24/06/2021, 11:31 - Paul: Without trying to spoil it, I fucking hated the 2nd half of it but the premise was cool
24/06/2021, 11:32 - Wezz: Self fulfilling and scary
24/06/2021, 11:34 - Paul: The second part of his study involved a hospital administration challenging Rosenhan to send pseudopatients to its facility, whose staff asserted that they would be able to detect the pseudopatients. Rosenhan agreed, and in the following weeks 41 out of 193 new patients were identified as potential pseudopatients, with 19 of these receiving suspicion from at least one psychiatrist and one other staff member. Rosenhan sent no pseudopatients to the hospital.

lmao rekt
24/06/2021, 11:37 - Wezz: Irony is, I imagine the whole situation has driven her to insanity if she wasn't already. Young celeb not the most stable of upbringings. Now fans involved immediately the family are the bad guys and she clearly wants 'change'. Cluster fuck where the awareness should create due process, not skip it or affect it.
24/06/2021, 11:38 - Paul: I think the reason this is more enraging is just how egregious it is. So she can perform a show in Vegas 7 days a week but can't control her own money? And the people in control of her fortune are the ones who make that decision? Madness
24/06/2021, 11:40 - Wezz: That's hilarious. Paranoia -> increased scrutiny. Wonder if any of it led to improvements in diagnostic criteria, or just a "fuck you" lol
24/06/2021, 11:43 - Wezz: It's another, hugely emotional situation. That likely started with good faith and intentions. Now it's very hard to deduce those and it requires third party review..  just not by the bloody public lol.
24/06/2021, 11:44 - Paul: No doubt, always need to know all the facts. But I find it increasingly difficult to justify her Fathers actions for anything other than greed
24/06/2021, 11:45 - Wezz: It's so complicated too, look at the Winehouse scenario. Similar, family driven workload. She rebelled, found love and other support, self medicated, all that. Public supported her. GG no re.
24/06/2021, 11:47 - Paul: I guess from a philosophical point of view, Winehouse at least had her freedom to do what she did
24/06/2021, 11:47 - Wezz: Far more complicated since her dad would encourage tours and not cancel, in his eyes getting her away from the problem, her friends would steal her passport so she couldn't travel cause she was unfit. Shit cycle of behaviour continues. Different situation but imagine the forces at play could be similar.
24/06/2021, 11:47 - Wezz: True. Did end up killing her though.
24/06/2021, 11:47 - Wezz: If you're a parent, you're gonna try to fight against that..idk
24/06/2021, 11:47 - Paul: Yeah that's what I mean, but in a weird way that's her right lol
24/06/2021, 11:47 - Paul: Oh for sure
24/06/2021, 11:48 - Paul: But as you said, totally different situation and behaviours
24/06/2021, 11:49 - Paul: Having her own agency and autonomy over her choices just feels so paramount the issue. Even if there are of course examples where that goes wrong
24/06/2021, 11:49 - Paul: to the issue*
24/06/2021, 11:52 - Wezz: Yeah I agree. I think it's the most accepted, summarised, view on the topic. The public method will break existing family ties, and I feel the outcome isn't going to be what her fans are hoping for.
24/06/2021, 11:53 - Paul: I just hope it opens a dialogue about the abuse under conservatorship in general
24/06/2021, 11:53 - Piper: The truth behind all the eyes
24/06/2021, 11:58 - Paul: ü§Ø
24/06/2021, 12:28 - Derren: <Media omitted>
24/06/2021, 13:31 - Paul: Doesn't say Sancho so no. Must have been Wezz
24/06/2021, 13:46 - Paul: https://v.redd.it/cv3jsocp57771
24/06/2021, 13:53 - Wezz: I'm actually offended. The amount I've sucked Grealish dick and you say Paul.
24/06/2021, 13:54 - Wezz: Shame your 120+ IQ doesn't sort your goldfish memory out Derek
24/06/2021, 13:56 - Derren: It's not memory I don't read a lot of stuff you guys type here so I don't check the names :D
24/06/2021, 13:56 - Derren: I just scim over stuff
24/06/2021, 13:56 - Wezz: Skim yeah?
24/06/2021, 13:57 - Wezz: (got em, stolen at least 5 IQ) first bump in my smoothbrain
24/06/2021, 13:57 - Derren: Whatever fam
24/06/2021, 14:02 - Wezz: I'm sorry, let my white fragility take over for a minute. Love you.

24/06/2021, 14:08 - Qck: im selling a rune scimmy if that's what you meant

24/06/2021, 14:13 - Derren: Nice scam Sam
24/06/2021, 14:18 - Qck: trying to give you mates rates to help you in the wildy bro
24/06/2021, 14:43 - Noone: I remember luring new players into the wilderness to see the "GP troll". I'd take them to the church with the golden chalice, tell them to click on it. When they did, the monks all attacked the player and I stood by the door watching
24/06/2021, 14:43 - Noone: that was my first experience of pvp in any online game. I never reached that level of adrenaline since, not even in EvE Online fleet battles
24/06/2021, 14:43 - Paul: i picture you with a vacant stare
24/06/2021, 15:51 - Derren: https://twitter.com/AndySlater/status/1408051917964595202
24/06/2021, 15:51 - Derren: God damn
24/06/2021, 15:52 - Noone: weeeeee
24/06/2021, 15:54 - Qck: surf's up
24/06/2021, 15:57 - Qck: pretty crazy to see the chickens come home to roost in the States as their post-war infrastructure is on its last legs and we see more and more bridges, buildings and towns (Flint) get absolutely decimated due to long-term beurocracy and short-term solutions
24/06/2021, 15:58 - Derren: Well the bigger problem is with florida in general isn't most of it technically underwater meaning sink holes are a very common thing
24/06/2021, 16:00 - Qck: yarp I think surfside in particular is guilty of that considering it's more or less a floating archipelago
24/06/2021, 16:02 - Wezz: Holy shit, I thought London had bad subsidence.
24/06/2021, 16:02 - Derren: Also mostly limestone
24/06/2021, 16:02 - Derren: üòÇ
24/06/2021, 16:08 - Derren: @447850499652 https://fb.watch/6kmiH0JzGx/  why can't you do cool stuff like this
24/06/2021, 16:13 - Qck: longboards will never be cool p.m.y.
24/06/2021, 16:14 - Qck: (prove me wrong)
24/06/2021, 16:15 - Qck: with a y instead of a w because I'm apparently word retarded
24/06/2021, 16:20 - Noone: Footplant shoveits are gay everyone knows it
24/06/2021, 16:21 - Noone: A lot cooler than inline skates
24/06/2021, 16:21 - Qck: 80s Tony Hawk and Caballero would like a word
24/06/2021, 16:23 - Noone: Hawk was always in pipes and caballero in bowls, footplants then are cool. But on flat, if you're talking about Rodney Mullen then I'm pretty sure he moved past footplants pretty quick
24/06/2021, 16:23 - Qck: No I'm talking about Hawk and Caballero street skating for Bones Brigade
24/06/2021, 16:24 - Qck: As that's all they would do around LA, pretty sure Perralta has all the old videos on his jewtube
24/06/2021, 16:24 - Noone: Oh you mean "watch us Ollie things"
24/06/2021, 16:24 - Qck: There were manuals and a lot of shove-its involved too
24/06/2021, 16:25 - Qck: They're actually pretty dope lemme see if I can find a good one
24/06/2021, 16:25 - Qck: https://youtu.be/5ULjSuzhs6E
24/06/2021, 16:27 - Noone: oh boy oh boy
24/06/2021, 16:34 - Paul: bureaucracy*
24/06/2021, 16:36 - Qck: are you really having a pop at a drug addict's spelling?
24/06/2021, 16:37 - Qck: new low for dr. fish
24/06/2021, 16:37 - Paul: Yeah what you gonna do?
24/06/2021, 16:38 - Qck: tell rachel
24/06/2021, 16:38 - Paul: "Whose this creepy serial killer messaging me about my brother"
24/06/2021, 16:39 - Noone: he's more of a drug dealer than a serial killer
24/06/2021, 16:39 - Qck: more like "oh my god he's finally replied to the pic i sent of my snatch"
24/06/2021, 16:39 - Noone: why did she send you a picture of her copy of the film "Snatch", by Guy Ritchie?
24/06/2021, 16:39 - Noone: Why would she send you that?
24/06/2021, 16:39 - James: It's a classic
24/06/2021, 16:40 - Paul: "You're only supposed to blow the bloody doors off" - Gandalf
24/06/2021, 16:40 - James: "Do or do not, there is no try" Mahatma Gandalf
24/06/2021, 16:41 - Qck: "my snatch smells" - you know who
24/06/2021, 16:41 - Noone: when someone tries to take your wizard hat and 12" Gandalf doll, "Ma hat, ma Gandalf."
24/06/2021, 16:42 - James: Nice
24/06/2021, 16:50 - Paul: UK banning junk food advertisements before 9pm
24/06/2021, 16:50 - James: Big Brother only wants you eating regulation health paste
24/06/2021, 16:52 - Noone: they're also "reconsidering" lockdown restrictions on foreign countries because the holiday industry won't stfu wingeing
24/06/2021, 16:52 - Noone: how much longer until I'm made PM
24/06/2021, 16:52 - Paul: I heard your rates jumped up massively last few days
24/06/2021, 16:53 - Noone: our rates?
24/06/2021, 16:53 - Noone: oh, infection rates
24/06/2021, 16:53 - Paul: Covid rates
24/06/2021, 16:53 - James: Mortgage rates
24/06/2021, 16:54 - Noone: well yeah, thanks to the delta variant ((((Indians prancing around in a shit and corpse filled river packed shoulder to shoulder))))) we're fucked again
24/06/2021, 16:54 - Noone: we're not allowed to call it the indian variant any more though, just the delta variant now. But the effect is places like Germany won't allow travellers from GB anymore
24/06/2021, 16:54 - Noone: diversity is our strength
24/06/2021, 16:55 - Noone: sorry I went a bit too hard there, umm
24/06/2021, 16:55 - Noone: James is called woodwork
24/06/2021, 16:56 - James: Don't forget the terracotta pudding
24/06/2021, 16:56 - Dayle: disclosure - i have ordered a bottle of gin and its being delivered soon so this might digress into random videos of me taking shots and generally having a great time just a public service announcement, Also im a massive fan of the smooth brain gang
24/06/2021, 16:57 - Dayle: Also holidays for double jabbers woohoo - lads holiday? lads lads lads
24/06/2021, 16:57 - Noone: why go on holiday when you've got these great british isles to explore? I don't think I'll ever leave the country again
24/06/2021, 16:58 - James: Is it because you're now on a list because of the things you've been googling?
24/06/2021, 16:58 - Noone: instead of Spain, why not Margate? Instead of Vegas, why not the casino in Reading? instead of dubai, why not Shepherds bush?
24/06/2021, 16:58 - James: To be fair, I do have a t-shirt that says Margate, I don't have one that says Spain. 1-0 to Margate
24/06/2021, 16:59 - Noone: you hear that Spain? Margate's back
24/06/2021, 16:59 - Qck: pretty sure shepherds bush is more like marrakesh
24/06/2021, 16:59 - Noone: instead of Africa or the middle east or China or india why not Shepherds bush?
24/06/2021, 17:00 - Dayle: instead of shepherds bush, whats about shepherds bush
24/06/2021, 17:00 - Noone: great idea!
24/06/2021, 17:00 - Noone: you see gang, we can just stay in this great nation of ours
24/06/2021, 17:00 - Noone: better yet, we can stay in our homes where it's safe
24/06/2021, 17:01 - Paul: Party at Jack's parents house
24/06/2021, 17:25 - Mike: I need some Android users to test my app this weekend, probably not of interest to you personally but it would be good to get eyes on different screen sizes. Any takers?
24/06/2021, 17:26 - Kirky: Do I get paid
24/06/2021, 17:26 - Mike: In MikeCoin
24/06/2021, 17:26 - Kirky: Perfect
24/06/2021, 17:28 - Noone: Mike coin actually costs money to hold onto
24/06/2021, 17:28 - Kirky: Even better
24/06/2021, 17:30 - Paul: My Samsung is old and bugs out all the time so it's perfect to QC an app
24/06/2021, 17:47 - Dayle: i have a s20 if you need that
24/06/2021, 17:50 - Derren: Mike tryna install bitcoin miners on our phones
24/06/2021, 17:52 - Mike: unfortunately play store strips miners out
24/06/2021, 17:53 - Derren: Thought you were gonna send us apk files
24/06/2021, 17:53 - Mike: na its above board, play store link with your email whitelisted so you can see it
24/06/2021, 17:53 - Wezz: Oh, shit's legit
24/06/2021, 17:54 - Wezz: Anything worth installing needs to force dev install on and come as an .apk from a pop up invested porn site.
24/06/2021, 17:54 - Wezz: Infested but invested works
24/06/2021, 17:55 - Wezz: JOB NEWS YET MATE?
24/06/2021, 17:55 - Wezz: Not that you don't usually midweek gin, but feels different.
24/06/2021, 17:57 - Wezz: Eat Greg's and breed with our relatives?
24/06/2021, 18:12 - Dayle: nope still aligning calendars mate
24/06/2021, 18:13 - Wezz: aligning dicks more like
24/06/2021, 19:08 - Dayle: Finally got a date 3 hour interview
24/06/2021, 19:08 - Dayle: July 1st wish me luck
24/06/2021, 19:09 - Mike: Fucking hell mate, they're gonna check your peeper too
24/06/2021, 19:09 - Dayle: Don't kn9w
24/06/2021, 19:09 - Dayle: <Media omitted>
24/06/2021, 19:10 - Mike: Is that actually back to back? Fucking lameos
24/06/2021, 19:14 - Derren: Put the wrong their, we know you got your mate to text that to you!
24/06/2021, 19:15 - Dayle: Imagine :)
24/06/2021, 19:25 - Dayle: Yeah honestly no fucking idea i think its abit technical then they drown my in business journey and where they wanna be etc
24/06/2021, 20:51 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
24/06/2021, 20:59 - Dayle: haha :D
25/06/2021, 09:38 - Mike: How long could you wear the same shirt or TShirt to work without someone commenting?
25/06/2021, 09:38 - Mike: Exclude people's works that would never comment
25/06/2021, 09:39 - Mike: E.g. uniform boys
25/06/2021, 09:47 - Noone: <Media omitted>
25/06/2021, 09:47 - James: Depends how generic it is I guess. A graphic tee that says 'Mondays right?' is probably fine on the Monday, but come Thursday people are going to be pretty grossed out. A navy shirt or black plain t shirt you could probably get away with a whole week as long as you didn't smell.
25/06/2021, 09:47 - James: How comes, you coming on to hard times Mike?
25/06/2021, 09:48 - Noone: He doesn't even go into the office just ignore him
25/06/2021, 09:48 - Wezz: Want me to get a few fruit of the loom in the post @447943624891 ?
25/06/2021, 09:51 - Kirky: 2 at most sometimes only 1 but I get sweaty
25/06/2021, 09:51 - Lockers: This is a question that bothers me regularly. I own too many shirts now because of it
25/06/2021, 09:51 - Dayle: Can you wash the tshirt?
25/06/2021, 09:53 - Mike: Washing allowed and encouraged
25/06/2021, 09:54 - Mike: Just thought I'd save time by not washing
25/06/2021, 09:55 - James: I think unless you're in heavy activity/hot weather, you can wear a t shirt/shirt three to four times non-consecutively
25/06/2021, 09:59 - Dayle: OK I would have a t shit that was white and I could dye with machine washable dye everyday.
25/06/2021, 09:59 - Dayle: So forever
25/06/2021, 10:00 - Dayle: T shirt ffs...
25/06/2021, 10:05 - Wezz: I think this is the norm. Undershirts can help extend the lifetime.
But I don't wear anything for more than 2 days, even at home doing nothing just feels bad. Plus after showering who wants to get into the same clothes.
25/06/2021, 10:06 - Wezz: Sorry missed your 'non-consecutively'
25/06/2021, 10:07 - Wezz: As a teacher I'm changing shirts every day, maybe re-wear one on the Friday. Mostly in fear of bullying from students
25/06/2021, 10:25 - Lockers: Bullying from students? Lol
25/06/2021, 10:26 - Wezz: What's the most embarrassing thing that's happened to you in front of students @447758520258 ?
25/06/2021, 10:28 - Lockers: Can't really think of anything that bad tbh. This morning though I went to visit a primary school to meet prospective students. It was actually a prep school, so real posh kids. Parents are pulling in with their new porsches etc and I felt that the rucksack I normally use wasn't suitable, but remembered that I had a nice leather satchel in my boot. So in front of all these parents I go to get the bag out of the boot, to expose the multitude of empty budweiser boxes from last night's trip to the bottle bank to all of the posh parents
25/06/2021, 10:28 - Lockers: Looked a cunt
25/06/2021, 10:28 - Lockers: Then hit my head on the boot. Sad times
25/06/2021, 10:31 - Kirky: üòÇüòÇüòÇüëåüëåüëåüëå
25/06/2021, 10:34 - Qck: "Can't really think of anything that bad in my entire career as a teacher... anyway here's a bad thing that happened literally an hour ago"
25/06/2021, 10:35 - Lockers: He said in front of the students!
25/06/2021, 10:35 - Lockers: These weren't my students
25/06/2021, 10:35 - Lockers: Don't count
25/06/2021, 10:36 - Qck: Haha that's true, just thought as a teacher you saw everyone as a student with a mind filled with possibilities
25/06/2021, 10:36 - Lockers: Erm... Yeah that's it
25/06/2021, 10:41 - Wezz: üòÇ officially asking this question every morning
25/06/2021, 10:42 - Wezz: We were awful to our teachers, do you have a colleague who gets bullied by the kids? Like, zero classroom respect/discipline?
25/06/2021, 10:43 - Wezz: If you can't tell, I want to hear about the misfortune of others...
25/06/2021, 11:01 - Kirky: I had a maths teacher with a fake ear
25/06/2021, 11:01 - Kirky: Kid got suspended cause he tried to pull it off
25/06/2021, 11:04 - Wezz: He taught my class too! Always got ear-y vibes from him though
25/06/2021, 11:06 - Paul: Mr Hunt
25/06/2021, 11:07 - Paul: Send me my t-shirt from the Christmas party it's been 6 months
25/06/2021, 11:07 - Kirky: Plus one
25/06/2021, 11:07 - Paul: Better question, how many months can you wear the same jeans before someone notices? How many years can you go without changing your bed sheets without someone noticing?
25/06/2021, 11:20 - James: Jeans don't need to be washed, they're made of anti-dirt, bedsheets are a myth, sleep on the floor
25/06/2021, 11:31 - Qck: Take up your jeans by a cm each day, when you're finally wearing jorts enjoy the praise that's bestowed upon you for taking risks with your fashion
25/06/2021, 11:32 - James: Eventually you've taken enough that you're wearing a jong, and it's a good look
25/06/2021, 11:32 - Qck: A jewlace jong
25/06/2021, 11:40 - Kirky: Window cleanser just closed his sliding side door on his thumb and couldnt reach the handle
25/06/2021, 11:40 - Kirky: Stood there shouting for help. Didnt realise he was shouting at me and just plodded around delivering my mail ignoring him for a minute üòÇüòÇüëå
25/06/2021, 11:41 - Paul: Oi mailman fucking help me! "Well he could be talking to anyone"
25/06/2021, 11:48 - Wezz: Are jongs finally back in yet? Been waiting for this day.
25/06/2021, 11:50 - James: Frayed so
25/06/2021, 11:56 - Wezz: Could speak about this guy for hours. The state of him.
25/06/2021, 13:11 - Noone: <Media omitted>
25/06/2021, 13:46 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
25/06/2021, 14:09 - Qck: Such funny news
25/06/2021, 14:17 - Dayle: Anyone got the m1 mac book pro? If so what are your thoughts on it?
25/06/2021, 14:19 - Derren: Only for setting up for work but looking at reviews and benchmarks etc it's really good
25/06/2021, 14:19 - Derren: Why not get an ipad Pro instead
25/06/2021, 14:21 - Paul: Why don't you poo on your own head
25/06/2021, 14:25 - Wezz: A surprisingly challenging feat
25/06/2021, 14:41 - Derren: <Media omitted>
25/06/2021, 14:43 - Wezz: GOOD WORK MATE ‚ù§Ô∏è
25/06/2021, 14:43 - Derren: Has my iq increased now
25/06/2021, 14:44 - Noone: the vaccine attacks turkish hormonal deficiencies, good job dickhead enjoy the increased buildup of plaque in your brain
25/06/2021, 14:44 - Noone: sheeplet
25/06/2021, 14:49 - Kirky: Imagine having a calcified pineal gland ü§£ü§£üëå
25/06/2021, 14:49 - Noone: *IMAGINE*
25/06/2021, 14:53 - Piper: Lol daren fell for it
25/06/2021, 14:58 - Derren: Fucking pigeon nearly shit on me
25/06/2021, 14:58 - Derren: Literally 2 inches away from it hitting my shoulder
25/06/2021, 14:58 - Kirky: That's a sign for sure
25/06/2021, 14:58 - Derren: Also Jack I have no idea how much of my genome belongs to what ethnicity
25/06/2021, 14:59 - Noone: I do: too much
25/06/2021, 14:59 - Derren: I'm sure I'm a stupid mix of Turkish Greek Arab kurd turkic maybe some Persian and mongol too
25/06/2021, 14:59 - Kirky: Mongrol?

26/06/2021, 21:01 - Paul: Is that one of those stores that tracks you in the shop and just sends you the payment later? I remember that being advertised years ago
26/06/2021, 21:01 - Lee: Exactly that.
26/06/2021, 21:02 - Lee: I bought a pecan slice and some fizzy rainbow belts.
26/06/2021, 21:02 - Lee: I picked up some things, and put them back, just to see what happens.
26/06/2021, 21:02 - Paul: What sort of stuff do they sell?
26/06/2021, 21:03 - Lee: They have a deal with morrisons. So basically it's that.
26/06/2021, 21:03 - Paul: So just like a generic average super market?

26/06/2021, 21:04 - Lee: Totally normal supermarket.
26/06/2021, 21:04 - Lee: The one I went to in Camden has been open for two weeks.

Steam Help --> Games And Applications --> Farcry 5 --> Refund
26/06/2021, 21:17 - Kirky: do you get a running total while you shop ?
26/06/2021, 21:18 - Paul: But you don't have to do that right? You can just play it normally?
26/06/2021, 21:21 - Noone: no but part of the fun of 3 was the grind for all the cool guns
26/06/2021, 21:21 - Paul: Oh so the store only had silver bars? No guns?
26/06/2021, 21:21 - Paul: That's stupid
26/06/2021, 21:24 - Kirky: stores sell guns right? im sure thats where i got them
26/06/2021, 21:25 - Paul: Then I don't get it
26/06/2021, 21:36 - Mike: Jack hates all microtransactions, not just those optional
26/06/2021, 21:37 - Paul: Pay to win in a multiplayer I can understand hating. But in a single player who gives a shit? I could also open console in Skyrim and glitch through doors if I wanted
26/06/2021, 21:44 - Mike: <Media omitted>
26/06/2021, 21:46 - Noone: I dunno, just felt really shit being sold something like skins in a fucking singleplayer experience

27/06/2021, 20:32 - Paul: Looking at the bracket I reckon there's a solid chance that winner of Germany England makes the final
27/06/2021, 20:35 - Lockers: Yup
27/06/2021, 20:35 - Lockers: Although don't underrate Denmark

28/06/2021, 13:02 - Paul: Anyone here know about kiwi farms? Could maybe give me a summary?
28/06/2021, 13:34 - Nathan: I believe they use similar farming techniques as we do. Would recommend calling them New Zealanders though not Kiwi's
28/06/2021, 13:45 - James: Yeah, it's not very PC Paul, though I know that's fashionable in Germany
28/06/2021, 14:49 - Paul: Ok sorry

28/06/2021, 18:46 - Kirky: @447943624891  TIL that Maui in Maori Mythology- who influenced Maui from Disney's Moana- turned into a worm so that he could climb into the vagina of the Goddess of Night in order to grant immortality to humanity. He was killed when she woke up and crushed him with her obsidian vaginal teeth.
28/06/2021, 18:46 - Kirky: think of this next time you play moana on groovy
28/06/2021, 18:50 - Lee: This game though.

28/06/2021, 20:38 - Wezz: I'm watching fine on some shoddy illegal site, no idea where their feed is coming from
28/06/2021, 20:41 - Lee: I'm now watching it on freeintertv
28/06/2021, 20:41 - Lee: What the fuck.
28/06/2021, 20:41 - Lee: Am I supposed to go downstairs and watch on actual TV?

28/06/2021, 22:23 - Lockers: What is the app?
28/06/2021, 22:24 - Mike: It's a companion app for Stardew Valley, a video game farming simulator. The testing  I need is literally just, open the app, note anything that looks weird, send me details
28/06/2021, 22:24 - Mike: No game knowledge needed, just tell me what stands out to you, what made you think "what is this" etc
28/06/2021, 22:25 - Paul: This just further guarantees that Germany vs England will somehow be incredibly boring
28/06/2021, 22:25 - Alex: Wouldn't have it any other way
28/06/2021, 22:26 - Mike: I'm planning to watch the game so it will be 0-0 guaranteed
28/06/2021, 22:27 - Lockers: Streaming numbers will be interesting
28/06/2021, 22:27 - Paul: How many times do I have to explain that this can't happen

28/06/2021, 22:31 - Lockers: It's happening right now man wtf!
28/06/2021, 22:31 - James: Don't encourage them
28/06/2021, 22:31 - Paul: Jack will stab you
28/06/2021, 22:32 - Paul: Do penalty goals count towards points?
28/06/2021, 22:32 - Lockers: I assume you're joking

28/06/2021, 22:47 - Alex: Isnt north to the left?
28/06/2021, 22:48 - Lockers: Actually annoying that West is on the right of that list üòÇ
28/06/2021, 22:48 - Mike: Never eat shredded wheat
28/06/2021, 22:48 - James: Really? It's clockwise, it would be weirder if the list started with west
28/06/2021, 22:49 - Paul: I think it was a DnD joke m8
28/06/2021, 22:49 - Alex: When mike was dm he did a whole campaign when the compass was out by 90¬∞ because he's a sexual deviant
28/06/2021, 22:49 - Mike: <Media omitted>
28/06/2021, 22:49 - Lockers: Oh no I get it, but west being on the right of a list just gets me
28/06/2021, 22:49 - Alex: The apostrophe is grammatically correct though
28/06/2021, 22:50 - Mike: Uh oh
28/06/2021, 22:50 - Alex: It feels like it should be west north south east

28/06/2021, 22:55 - Mike: Outrageous
28/06/2021, 22:56 - Wezz: Oh, LOOK WHO'S CHANGED THEIR TUNE.
28/06/2021, 22:56 - Wezz: Had to 1v2 these teachers to get them to acknowledge possessive apostrophes üí™
28/06/2021, 22:57 - Lockers: Nobody asked your opinion: go to bed
28/06/2021, 22:58 - Alex: Did I ever disagree to possessive apostrophes? I mean maybe, but I dont think so
28/06/2021, 22:59 - Wezz: More specifically, possessive apostrophes despite names ending in an S.
28/06/2021, 22:59 - Paul: Apostrophes's*
28/06/2021, 23:00 - Qck: I mean Wezz's agreement belongs to the apostrophe so I see no argument here
28/06/2021, 23:01 - Wezz: We won't talk about the Fantasy League
28/06/2021, 23:02 - Paul: Wait for the update I reckon
28/06/2021, 23:03 - Mike: My entire team is greyed out, did all my players have heart attacks?

28/06/2021, 23:05 - Mike: Fuck, Football is a tough game
28/06/2021, 23:05 - Wezz: Congratulations, your team made it to the bonus Grey game. It's after Extra Time.
28/06/2021, 23:05 - Paul: Careful James is gonna flip out
28/06/2021, 23:05 - Lockers: Imagine doing a degree in it
28/06/2021, 23:05 - Mike: But before üçµ time?
28/06/2021, 23:08 - Wezz: So you have; First Half, Extra Time A, Second Half, Added Time A, Injury Time A, Stoppage Time A, Extra Time B, Extra Half 1 (some call it the third quarter), Extra Half 1 Extra Time, Bit 'o' Water break, Extra Half 2 (no one calls it the fourth quarter), Extra Half 2 Extra Time, Penis Time, Sudden Death Penis.

Then Grey Bonus game. I'll save you from the rest
28/06/2021, 23:22 - James: I don't know why Tweedledee and Tweedledum didn't explain it like this, makes sense now, thanks Sam!

You can put a leading number Infront of the 0, like 1, highlight between them, delete one and insert any non-numeric from keyboard for the same crash effect too.
28/06/2021, 23:59 - Wezz: Thing is, you limit to numpad on the keyboard
28/06/2021, 23:59 - Wezz: (at least on my phone)
29/06/2021, 00:00 - Mike: Numpad has , or . Though right?
29/06/2021, 00:00 - Wezz: yes
29/06/2021, 00:00 - Wezz: you're very right
29/06/2021, 00:00 - Wezz: that does the same
29/06/2021, 00:01 - Mike: Even easier, just delete the number lmao
29/06/2021, 00:01 - Mike: Click and highlight on the input, delete the number with backspace
29/06/2021, 00:01 - Wezz: wowzer

29/06/2021, 00:02 - Wezz: inc no.2
29/06/2021, 00:02 - Wezz: Is there an upper limit to the number of crates?
29/06/2021, 00:03 - Mike: Nope, but if it's the same text input bug I will penalise you
29/06/2021, 00:04 - Wezz: Penalise the white hat? I just wanna farm nans man
29/06/2021, 00:04 - Wezz: So your level's on char screen work fine, when deleting they reset to 0. need to do same on calendar year.
29/06/2021, 00:04 - Wezz: Now, next bug
29/06/2021, 00:08 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
29/06/2021, 00:10 - Wezz: Call it 1.5 bugs if you will. Only worked after restart of app
29/06/2021, 00:13 - Wezz: Farming value changes from N/A to blank after restart?.. gotta go sleeps now üôè
29/06/2021, 00:15 - Mike: If it's induced from the input I'm gonna call it the same bug, I will tell you there is at least one other app crashing bug up for grabs though as I just noticed it. Maybe one to look at tomorrow, but üíØ still there as I just found it

29/06/2021, 17:17 - Paul: They boo'd them all taking a knee tbf
29/06/2021, 17:18 - Mike: Look who's swapped sides boys
29/06/2021, 17:18 - Mike: Never thought I'd see the day

29/06/2021, 17:19 - Noone: CAM ON ENGERLAND
29/06/2021, 17:19 - Paul: I just swear it's only the dickhead English fans
29/06/2021, 17:21 - Qck: Yeah because there's no room for politics in sports, I normally just blast my vuvuzuela out of the window and scream "free derek chauvin" whenever they dare kneel in protest of kfc only doing their kansas bbq bites for a limited time only*

*I imagine that's what they're kneeling for as the day of reckoning will be soon upon us and I will be forced to eat regular popcorn chicken like a cunt
29/06/2021, 17:22 - Paul: Is this a veiled insult at Kentucky
29/06/2021, 17:22 - Qck: Maguire's forehead is a cannon
29/06/2021, 17:23 - Noone: BOOOOOOOOOOO

29/06/2021, 17:27 - Dayle: <Media omitted>
29/06/2021, 17:28 - Paul: Every time the ball goes into the bottom left corner they switch to this retarded disorienting camera that loses the flow of the game. And it's only in that corner. Every game so far
29/06/2021, 17:31 - Noone: BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

29/06/2021, 19:00 - Kirky: is he jewish or something@?
29/06/2021, 19:01 - Paul: He missed the crucial penalty vs Germany in 96 to stop us going to the final
29/06/2021, 19:02 - Kirky: what a loser
29/06/2021, 19:05 - Paul: That's all the group of death teams eliminated right

29/06/2021, 20:26 - Mike: A lot of these are picked line by line by the owner

29/06/2021, 20:30 - Dayle: Second

29/06/2021, 22:13 - Mike: That red card was unnecessary tbh
29/06/2021, 22:14 - Mike: Guy ran his knee into his foot
29/06/2021, 22:14 - Mike: I read yours out to Nessya and Piper, no laughs. Sad times, I loved it

29/06/2021, 22:39 - Lockers: His leg was still fucked, thought you were arguing the red. Another chat

29/06/2021, 22:43 - Piper: Yea its used caused they can't wear wristbands or anything
29/06/2021, 22:44 - Lockers: Shut up piper. Go talk about hernandez somewhere else
29/06/2021, 22:44 - Wezz: Yeah... I kinda guessed with the fact it says STATS SPORTS on it.
29/06/2021, 22:45 - Lockers: Good guess m8, proud of you
29/06/2021, 22:45 - Wezz: With a little ECG reading..
29/06/2021, 22:45 - Wezz: But thanks boys
29/06/2021, 22:45 - Paul: It's tough to say it's not a red after seeing the reply but he did win the ball and the other guy did collide with him. Tough one
29/06/2021, 22:45 - Lockers: Not tough. Not a red
29/06/2021, 22:46 - Paul: Was a red though I saw it
29/06/2021, 22:46 - Paul: He pulled it out of his top pocket
29/06/2021, 22:46 - Piper: booo
29/06/2021, 22:46 - Lockers: Colourblind
29/06/2021, 22:47 - Lockers: Sweden woz robbed
29/06/2021, 22:49 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
29/06/2021, 22:49 - Paul: Seems to be creating a lot of controversy and discussion. I'd say tough is a fair description.

29/06/2021, 23:01 - Lockers: NA NA
29/06/2021, 23:55 - Derren: Nice to hear a woman screaming at a man in the middle of the street at midnight saying "you were fucking little girls behind my fucking back in my fucking flat you cunt"
29/06/2021, 23:57 - Mike: "a man", Derren?
29/06/2021, 23:58 - Derren: Hmm?
29/06/2021, 23:58 - Mike: You*
29/06/2021, 23:58 - Noone: it was you wasn't it
29/06/2021, 23:58 - Derren: I'm in bed trying to fucking sleep
29/06/2021, 23:58 - Derren: And I hear this bitch screaming
30/06/2021, 00:07 - Mike: Likely alibi
30/06/2021, 00:16 - Dayle: Whos this little boy i dont condone this

30/06/2021, 09:06 - Derren: She took a pic of her phone üëÄ
30/06/2021, 09:16 - Paul: What is leng
30/06/2021, 09:23 - James: Man's speccin' her mad bunda
30/06/2021, 09:26 - Wezz: Only thing maybe slightly defensible is it might be her work phone? Since assuming she's using another phone for the pic
30/06/2021, 09:26 - Paul: Ok I've learned what leng means. I think the real issue was he was too slow with the dick pic
30/06/2021, 09:27 - Derren: yeah but it's easy to transfer via email or whatsapp to yourself
30/06/2021, 09:27 - Wezz: Evidence
30/06/2021, 09:27 - Wezz: I mean, she's going public anyway. But w/e
30/06/2021, 09:30 - James: Some work phones lock down functionality like screenshot to protect the data on it
30/06/2021, 09:33 - Paul: Every year we're breaking heatwave records. Shit is getting scary
30/06/2021, 09:35 - Paul: <Media omitted>
30/06/2021, 09:35 - Derren: Learn Russian, they'll be in the best position in a warmer world
30/06/2021, 09:35 - Paul: I can't even learn German properly and I live here
30/06/2021, 09:36 - Derren: Access to the arctic sea a lot more during the year, new shipping routes from china to europe around russia rather than suez canal
30/06/2021, 09:36 - Derren: A lot more land becoming fertile etc due to snow/ice melting in siberia
30/06/2021, 09:36 - Paul: Yes colder places will last longer. That's hardly reassuring
30/06/2021, 09:37 - Derren: Also only 1 of their 5 main cities is by a body of water
30/06/2021, 09:37 - Derren: So less damage due to rising sea levels unlike every other major city in every country in the world
30/06/2021, 09:39 - Derren: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbfl9yjTWjI
30/06/2021, 09:39 - Derren: Remember this shit, look at the guy just standing there with a fucking rocket launcher
30/06/2021, 09:39 - Paul: Commoditization and consumerism have destroyed the planet. Capitalism has doomed the world. Come at me @447850499652 @447561062944
30/06/2021, 09:48 - Mike: Yeh but we got a real life dragon sleeping on a pile of gold in a mountain @bezos
30/06/2021, 09:49 - Noone: It's a recruiter, pretty low down the iq chain. Ask Derren
30/06/2021, 09:49 - Noone: You'll grow out of this eventually
30/06/2021, 09:50 - James: I read a proposal recently that after you have ¬£10 million, security should become your own problem, so we would have people planning raids on the rich like dragon slayers
30/06/2021, 09:50 - Paul: Someone did the math on Smaugs gold net worth and figured out that Jeff Bezos is actually richer than a literal gold hording dragon
30/06/2021, 09:50 - Derren: How will your thoughts change when you have dhilren?
30/06/2021, 09:51 - Paul: This is playing on my mind a lot recently. Is it unethical to have children? Feels like it is. Feels selfish
30/06/2021, 09:52 - Noone: They'll change to "how can I leave my wealth to my children" whilst you lot are being driven into the mountains to scratch a living off of rocks!
30/06/2021, 09:52 - Noone: For you it is unethical
30/06/2021, 09:52 - Paul: Even if I raise them to be communist super soldiers in the great Gates Musk war?
30/06/2021, 09:53 - James: Which side of that is communist Paul?
30/06/2021, 09:53 - Paul: No it's the whole world vs them
30/06/2021, 09:54 - Paul: They've fused into 1 entity of pure greed
30/06/2021, 09:54 - Noone: My hyper intelligent children raised on sugar and anime will be drone striking your kids as they toil in the fields for their bread rations
30/06/2021, 09:56 - Paul: Yeah but they'll have boneitis and no muscle mass from being raised in a sterile clean room. While my tanned rebel fighters will have muscle for days with their hoes and tractors
30/06/2021, 09:57 - Noone: Sorry kids but the commune doesn't need another poet, maybe go and sign up for the radiation clean up
30/06/2021, 09:58 - Paul: Also be careful Jack. Don't want them getting too intelligent or they'll realise you're teaching them bs
30/06/2021, 09:58 - Noone: Get back to work plough boy, you're 18tons short of your daily slop
30/06/2021, 09:59 - Paul: Yeah remember all those successful tribes of poets because no one wanted to do the important stuff
30/06/2021, 10:00 - Paul: I thought us socialists were the lazy ones
30/06/2021, 10:00 - Noone: You aren't lazy, you just want everyone to have the same shit prospects as the bottom   10% of morons
30/06/2021, 10:01 - Paul: You think we'd all have shit prospects if we shared out things equally? Plus that's not what I want
30/06/2021, 10:02 - Noone: What you want is an end to democracy, and end to America everybody! He wants your children in chains!!
30/06/2021, 10:03 - Paul: This is your life on capitalism. See through his irony for his little scared quivering legs
30/06/2021, 10:03 - Noone: But real talk, I'm sure another go at communism definitely wouldn't end the exact same way every other attempt at communism has, this time it'll be different everyone
30/06/2021, 10:03 - Paul: Imagine if scientists were so defeatist
30/06/2021, 10:04 - Noone: That's my boneitis, don't discriminate
30/06/2021, 10:04 - Paul: Well we tried. I guess humans won't ever fly
30/06/2021, 10:04 - Noone: Consequence of scientists giving an experiment another crack doesn't end in X million people starving because your political theory was written by angry GCSE students
30/06/2021, 10:05 - Paul: Whereas no one dies under capitalism
30/06/2021, 10:05 - Noone: Less people do, utilitarian
30/06/2021, 10:05 - Paul: Not true
30/06/2021, 10:05 - Noone: Waiting on middling mike to come into this and say "ooh boys surely there's good things about both systems"
30/06/2021, 10:06 - Paul: Less people do in rich countries that exploit the other countries so you can be thankful for that I guess? Yay us
30/06/2021, 10:06 - Paul: I've gotta walk Fred but this isn't over Jack. Mark my words
30/06/2021, 10:07 - Noone: Fuck poor countries, they're there for us to exploit
30/06/2021, 10:07 - Noone: If god didn't want us to exploit shit holes then he would have made them rich like us
30/06/2021, 10:33 - Noone: Looks like commune boy has slipped down the mine shaft he was tasked with moving.
30/06/2021, 10:33 - James: but Jesus died for our sins, and being poor is a sin, so Jesus died for poor people, so they're spiritually rich
30/06/2021, 10:35 - Noone: Get this man out of my office.
And into a bigger office, he needs to be heard!

30/06/2021, 10:35 - James: *moonwalks into the office, and out of the corner facing window, plummeting to my death*
30/06/2021, 10:35 - Noone: I immediately regret installing the artificially intelligent robot arms into the boardroom, as it hasn't stopped clapping since I installed them
30/06/2021, 10:37 - James: There is a slow motion shot of me falling, the robotic hands applauding my final descent without a hint of irony. I'm finally appreciated.
30/06/2021, 10:55 - Paul: Is this a clever goalposts metaphor or just coincidence?
30/06/2021, 10:59 - Wezz: The retarded climate change deniers would say your graph doesn't go back far enough. Sedimentary rocks (?) show gradual hot cold fluctuations over hundreds of years. We'll start cooling in 2100 (conveniently when it's too late to reverse damage)
30/06/2021, 11:00 - Wezz: I'm making shit up for fun at this point. Got so much work to do fml
30/06/2021, 11:01 - Paul: Yeah this is the argument Matt Kime used a lot. But the recent trend is far above estimations of co2 even in models that account for that stuff
30/06/2021, 11:03 - Wezz: Brilliant
30/06/2021, 11:04 - Wezz: Definition of copeism
30/06/2021, 11:05 - Wezz: Your model accounts for confounders? To complex, get out. Big oil money good.
30/06/2021, 11:06 - Wezz: Too*... obviously
30/06/2021, 11:06 - Paul: I dunno NASA made it not little old me ‚òπÔ∏è
30/06/2021, 11:08 - Wezz: Instead of adding new variables and changing the goal posts again. Maybe look at the ROCKS Paul. Study some GEOLOGY. Google it.
30/06/2021, 11:08 - Wezz: So about that fracking legislation...
30/06/2021, 11:09 - Paul: <Media omitted>
30/06/2021, 11:12 - Wezz: You need to come to England, so we can all sit down and fix the world. None of this 'capitalism is bad' stuff. We start with our Utopia from the bottom up and then let each other rip it apart until we all burst into tears and hug it out.
30/06/2021, 11:15 - Wezz: Well you'd burst into tears, Jack and I would pretend as we've eroded our morality in the pursuit of promised wealth.
30/06/2021, 11:21 - Noone: Piper's room smells like Piper itself
30/06/2021, 11:24 - Paul: I will only attend if the meeting is called capitalism is bad
30/06/2021, 11:25 - Piper: ?
30/06/2021, 13:01 - Mike: Capitalism for luxuries in life, socialism for essentials. Who decides what is a luxury? Supreme Ruler Eternal Mike does.

Peanuts? Luxury
Bread? Luxury.
Health care? .... Also luxury, I have the wealth now socialism is cancelled.
30/06/2021, 13:05 - Kirky: What do shots come under ?
30/06/2021, 13:06 - Mike: Necessity to life, minimum of 5 per day for adults and 2 per day for under 18s
30/06/2021, 13:06 - Kirky: Good shit I vote mike
30/06/2021, 13:10 - Alex: What do we get as necessities?
30/06/2021, 13:11 - Noone: Memes
Toilets
Toilet paper
Internet
30/06/2021, 13:19 - Paul: What about memes of bread and peanuts?
30/06/2021, 13:20 - Mike: Guards, take him away
30/06/2021, 13:20 - Alex: More progressive than the usa!
30/06/2021, 13:21 - Paul: Way too progressive for Jack. I don't buy it
30/06/2021, 13:56 - Qck: Can we retain the right to bear arms in this Miketopia?
30/06/2021, 13:59 - Wezz: Are Miketopia's laws upheld through violence like every other system? Cause I'm already planning a coup
30/06/2021, 14:00 - Paul: Did we settle on Miketopia? I'd like to throw in Miketropolis
30/06/2021, 14:04 - Mike: Only if you have big ones, little ones not allowed
30/06/2021, 14:04 - Mike: Yeh but this violence is incredibly overt so it's fair
30/06/2021, 14:17 - Noone: I want the right to bear arms, the right to freedom of speech and basically everything America has in its constitution
30/06/2021, 14:17 - Noone: I also want a Wendy's on my road and I want kirky to be able to order fast food via deliveroo in witney
30/06/2021, 14:23 - Mike: I have to give the Wendy's to the bears if you're getting their arms
30/06/2021, 14:36 - Kirky: I can now actually thanks Jack
30/06/2021, 14:36 - Kirky: Theres even a wine and liquor store on it now, life in this shit town is finally worth living. All thanks to miketopia

30/06/2021, 16:20 - Qck: 4:20 blaze it
30/06/2021, 16:21 - Wezz: I bet you I can think of a more shocking use than what Blondy Explainy boy has found out
30/06/2021, 16:21 - Wezz: E.g. COVID decapitator. Circumcision Vending Machine.
30/06/2021, 16:22 - Qck: Yeah who has time for Captain Autism and his fifth explanation of what a magnet is
30/06/2021, 16:23 - Wezz: He's also this weird aura about him, like he was _barely_ the most popular kid in the most upper class inbred school.

Still watch his videos ofc
30/06/2021, 16:23 - Qck: School prefect energy
30/06/2021, 16:24 - Qck: We get it Tom, magnets are magic controlled by the lizardjews who cares
30/06/2021, 16:26 - Wezz: That's what I'm looking for! It's like my brain amalgamated every school prefect into this pseudo-hip sigh fest
30/06/2021, 16:26 - Wezz: His feeling of self-worth, is so far from reality it upsets me
30/06/2021, 16:27 - Wezz: Sorry Tom, carry on with your 8 minute single take monologue
30/06/2021, 16:27 - Wezz: "umm, north south pole" fuuuckofff

30/06/2021, 18:21 - Paul: Legit do not see the appeal of this weird plastic woman
30/06/2021, 18:22 - Wezz: She's so strange man, first time I've heard her talk I think. What a weird accent. Posted more for our resident coomers @447757709019 @447588936693

30/06/2021, 20:12 - James: Mmm... Sweet venus
30/06/2021, 20:13 - Wezz: You think Derren chose to be a coomer? He made one mistake when he was 18, now he's a victim of the algorithm.
30/06/2021, 22:01 - Noone: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4NzNV7eo8

30/06/2021, 22:21 - Paul: But I don't go on YouTube to look at naked chicks... I go to basically every other website for that so it's good to have a sanctuary
30/06/2021, 22:26 - Wezz: https://streamable.com/wiam9b

Cheeky kneel
30/06/2021, 22:34 - Paul: Lol Bill Cosby conviction overturned on a technicality
30/06/2021, 22:37 - Paul: He wasn't able to plead the 5th due to a DA in 2005 making a statement that he wasn't going to be prosecuted. (You can't plead the 5th in civil court only criminal). So he admitted to all his rapes. And then the DA prosecuted him anyway. Can't do that. So Bill Cosby the rapist walks free
30/06/2021, 22:40 - Lockers: Wtf
30/06/2021, 22:43 - Wezz: Now he's out, at 83, hopefully a reporter can give him COVID.

01/07/2021, 00:10 - Wezz: Haven't seen it forever. Didn't know it was grapefruit, never liked grapefruit but liked Lilt.
01/07/2021, 00:11 - Wezz: Those extra sheets things were weird af. Prob got banned cause people put em on their eyeballs
01/07/2021, 00:12 - Wezz: Stick a couple of those on the outside of a condom. #mintyfresh
01/07/2021, 00:13 - Derren: probably the pineapple that does it what I miss is strawberry jelly + ice cream panda pops

01/07/2021, 13:37 - Mike: You stand alone old man
01/07/2021, 13:37 - Kirky: Add yourself to D and it's fine
01/07/2021, 13:38 - Paul: I love a good D
01/07/2021, 13:38 - Kirky: I assume bummers only at the bottom to keep the letter ranks in order, we'd actually fit between A and S
01/07/2021, 13:38 - Paul: it's not conceptually below E, but it's also technically below E
01/07/2021, 13:40 - Kirky: I will say the picture selection fits into the invisible S+ tier
01/07/2021, 13:41 - Paul: <Media omitted>
01/07/2021, 13:41 - Kirky: Perfect
01/07/2021, 13:41 - Paul: I think all the group lurkers deserve E tier, but I also love them
01/07/2021, 13:42 - Kirky: Maybe move yourself to C tier for forgetting misto
01/07/2021, 13:42 - Paul: it's not a finished list!
01/07/2021, 13:43 - Paul: Do I need to do 3 separate Dayles for each time he's rejoined?
01/07/2021, 13:44 - Kirky: üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

01/07/2021, 13:48 - Piper: 3 most handsome in S tier?
01/07/2021, 13:49 - Piper: every word i type demoting me?
01/07/2021, 13:55 - Paul: Yeah gotta be careful piper, you're S tier because of dropping bangers
01/07/2021, 13:56 - Paul: <Media omitted>
01/07/2021, 13:56 - Kirky: üëç

01/07/2021, 14:02 - Wezz: D for Derek
01/07/2021, 14:03 - Wezz: Looks like we have a place going in the BUMMERS GANG. Need 5 to clash üëä

01/07/2021, 14:05 - Paul: <Media omitted>
01/07/2021, 14:05 - Kirky: need to be close to the bumbers as our official sponsor
01/07/2021, 14:06 - Wezz: Can we get an S+ Tier for Drew? Feels dirty putting him in there with the mortals
01/07/2021, 14:06 - Noone: I am a S+ for sure
01/07/2021, 14:06 - Kirky: yea S+ -S for sure
01/07/2021, 14:06 - Paul: No sorry, but I could consider piper and James being lowered
01/07/2021, 14:07 - Paul: You're lucky I replaced F with bummers
01/07/2021, 14:07 - Noone: BOOOOOOO
01/07/2021, 14:10 - Noone: I'm in the actual worst place, I'm at the bottom this is an outrage
01/07/2021, 14:10 - Noone: I'll challenge this in the courts
01/07/2021, 14:14 - Wezz: I'm happy with my place. Would have liked to have been next to Dayle but it'll do.
01/07/2021, 14:14 - Paul: <Media omitted>
01/07/2021, 14:15 - Noone: You'll be hearing from my lawyer

01/07/2021, 14:17 - Paul: But actual explanation: solid work, but he's no Nathan
01/07/2021, 14:17 - Paul: wtf lol
01/07/2021, 14:19 - Paul: Sam Williams is a tricky one
01/07/2021, 14:19 - Wezz: We need someone in that E tier
01/07/2021, 14:19 - Paul: true
01/07/2021, 14:24 - James: Paul, this is a good list, you deserve a promotion up to C tier at least for this infographic
01/07/2021, 14:25 - Paul: <Media omitted>
01/07/2021, 14:25 - Paul: think thats everyone?
01/07/2021, 14:25 - James: Kayleigh agrees with Drew being S tier, she said that Drew is the best of Paul's friend. I assume I'm included in that list.
01/07/2021, 14:25 - James: friends*
01/07/2021, 14:26 - Paul: You're dangerously close to a demotion with your cheek
01/07/2021, 14:27 - James: Noted, thanks for the warning Paul
01/07/2021, 14:27 - James: I'll keep to the hot takes and witty banter, and leave the ranks to you
01/07/2021, 14:28 - Paul: Keep up the good work
01/07/2021, 14:28 - Paul: Just think Jack, you could have been up there with Sam and Dayle #2 if you'd kept your mouth shut
01/07/2021, 14:59 - Noone: Why does Dayle get two spots
01/07/2021, 15:00 - Noone: Dayle has THREE RANKS
01/07/2021, 15:00 - Mike: Based on blood alcohol levels
01/07/2021, 15:01 - Noone: Incredible sights
01/07/2021, 15:02 - Kirky: its the 3 different dayles that left and rejoined the chat
01/07/2021, 15:02 - Paul: This
01/07/2021, 15:04 - Paul: But to be clear. This isn't a loophole you can exploit to get a new rank Jack. It needs to be organic. Preferably based on some sort of bread related comment chain
01/07/2021, 15:07 - Derren: Piper should be in Ryan Gossling tier
01/07/2021, 15:08 - Lockers: Wait does my picture change to Chris Ramsey? Or did you just delete me
01/07/2021, 15:09 - Paul: No? You haven't moved from C
01/07/2021, 15:10 - Lockers: So I'm now Chris Ramsey

01/07/2021, 16:32 - Paul: Ah ok
01/07/2021, 16:32 - Wezz: Overheard someone say "I'm calling an ambulance" and there was ~5 people there so I left
01/07/2021, 16:35 - Paul: I thought it was more like one of those documentaries where the camera man stands 5 foot from a dying starving child
01/07/2021, 16:36 - Kirky: "I work at a hospital let me closer" just to take better pics for the group chat
01/07/2021, 17:04 - Qck: Finally, I now know my contributions are unwanted and no longer have to try to impress
01/07/2021, 17:06 - Paul: Hey man, people still want low tier content

01/07/2021, 18:26 - Paul: Mostly just randomly scrolled through people's Facebook. But for Mr Williams here's more elusive so I had to screenshot a video for the perfect pic
01/07/2021, 18:27 - Noone: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7VdAD7eNDk

01/07/2021, 18:54 - Alex: I've never felt more beta than seeing myself in the middle and saying nothing against it. Think I might kill myself
01/07/2021, 18:54 - Paul: You're surrounded on all sides by men. Just how you like it
01/07/2021, 18:54 - Kirky: atleast youre not the middle of the middle ay @447758520258 ?

01/07/2021, 19:03 - Mike: <Media omitted>
01/07/2021, 19:04 - Paul: Classic bummer tier comedy

01/07/2021, 20:41 - Kirky: I meant more you being between 2 people than how people feel about you
01/07/2021, 20:42 - Lockers: I'm used to it wheyyyy banter
01/07/2021, 20:42 - Kirky: Being bullied by 2 of your students isnt banter dude you need to stop them

01/07/2021, 20:57 - Lockers: Because you respect me yeah?
01/07/2021, 20:57 - Lockers: More of an insult to go into c
01/07/2021, 20:58 - Wezz: F for Fuckable
01/07/2021, 20:58 - Lockers: Oh how nice
01/07/2021, 21:14 - James: I just finished Jujitsu Kaisen if you haven't seen, would recommend
01/07/2021, 21:14 - Kirky: Oh nice yea havent seen. I'm currently watching a season of superstore every 3 days
01/07/2021, 21:15 - James: Superstore is really funny, Kayleigh and I just finished the first 5 seasons, as that's all that's on Netflix
01/07/2021, 21:16 - Kirky: Just started s4 üëå
01/07/2021, 22:15 - Noone: We remember our first visit
The service was exquisite!
_Why Joseph, I had no Idea!_
Come on now you were working here...
01/07/2021, 22:15 - Noone: we put the spriiiing in Springfield
01/07/2021, 22:16 - Paul: To shut this place down would be twisted
01/07/2021, 23:09 - Noone: our girls are here to be fisted!

02/07/2021, 00:03 - Mike: Probably only time in my life I'll link to the Daily Mail. Remember a few weeks ago I linked to an article of a childhood friend who jumped off a Hotel balcony on holiday and put himself into a coma? His younger brother today is a DM headline for being a drunk nobhead: https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9746825/Mother-yob-jostled-Chris-Whitty-apologises-says-son-misread-situation.html
02/07/2021, 00:30 - Mike: Game title pls
02/07/2021, 08:44 - Wezz: Your mates younger brother was the guy who was harassing Whitty?! Ahahaha
02/07/2021, 08:44 - Wezz: Apparently one of them lost their estate agent job as a result of the harassment
02/07/2021, 08:46 - Paul: Wouldn't really call that an "attack". Is he really autistic as well?
02/07/2021, 08:48 - Wezz: When I watched the vid I was majorly disappointed with how mild it was. People were saying he was put in a headlock. Hardly.
02/07/2021, 08:51 - Mike: Definitely diagnosed but I doubt you'd ever know speaking to him
02/07/2021, 08:53 - Mike: He was just being a drunken nob in this, other dude acting exactly same so the autism card probably not relevant
02/07/2021, 08:53 - Paul: Would definitely be relevant depending on the severity.
02/07/2021, 08:58 - Mike: His mum's a shrewd lady though, perfect mum response.
02/07/2021, 09:08 - Noone: he played the ADHD card and the autism card all in one go, that means his sympathy points have become positive and Witty technically owed him three acres of land
02/07/2021, 09:08 - Paul: <Media omitted>
02/07/2021, 09:09 - Noone: Soy because I'm not a soy boy
02/07/2021, 09:09 - Mike: Chilli
02/07/2021, 09:09 - Paul: 2 veggie options. I dig it
02/07/2021, 09:11 - Noone: get this cow hugger out of my restaurant
02/07/2021, 09:14 - Paul: I will now read you your ramen sign horoscopes.

Soy: you are a decent person with good intentions but sometimes feel sad. You occasionally worry about money.

Chili: You occasionally worry about money. You are also a decent person with good intentions but sometimes you feel sad.
02/07/2021, 09:17 - James: I think I'm a lime chili shrimp
02/07/2021, 09:20 - Paul: I bet you are you little slut
02/07/2021, 09:20 - Noone: horoscopes are the only "spiritual" thing I really believe in.
02/07/2021, 09:23 - Noone: <Media omitted>
02/07/2021, 09:27 - Wezz: Who'd of thought vague generalised statements would apply to _so many people_.
02/07/2021, 09:29 - Wezz: Lee was telling me some of the meat ones are vegetarian anyway? E.g. chicken and mushroom pot noodle
02/07/2021, 10:21 - Paul: Wait for real? That's my favourite one
02/07/2021, 10:24 - Paul: Such a typical Leo
02/07/2021, 10:28 - Noone: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DI16OAkqug so sad
02/07/2021, 10:35 - Paul: Fun fact about liberty the dog. He piloted a sitcom with Smokey the bear and Tony the tiger. It was about 2 roommates: 1 really clean and the other one kind of messy. What a hoot. They called it "gosh darn it Ned!" (That was his catch phrase). Shame that never took off
02/07/2021, 10:38 - Qck: That's a regular fact and you know it
02/07/2021, 10:40 - Paul: I don't know anything!!!
02/07/2021, 10:54 - Paul: <Media omitted>
02/07/2021, 11:06 - Wezz: The air is starchy.

A tidal wave of orange marmalade stings me from my slumber.

Hovis or Warburtons?
02/07/2021, 11:10 - Noone: piper is a bread fiend, he has bread on everything

02/07/2021, 15:41 - Kirky: I refunded it
02/07/2021, 15:49 - Lee: It's alright actually. Chop trees innit.
02/07/2021, 16:00 - Paul: This doesn't bode well
02/07/2021, 16:00 - Paul: Although if you refund things the same way back does
02/07/2021, 16:01 - Lee: Was too scary for Kirky.
02/07/2021, 16:10 - Kirky: It was ok

02/07/2021, 18:29 - Noone: You get a topic and a power point file from this website, and then you have to give a presentation on the topic from the slides as they prompt you, but the slides are semi random
02/07/2021, 18:31 - Lockers: I reckon I could do this

04/07/2021, 11:01 - Qck: Where the fuck was my invite to Giraffe Karaoke
04/07/2021, 13:40 - Qck: That's right you bunch of shrinking violets you knew that my unique rendition of wuthering heights would have brought the house down and out of sheer jealousy you vetoed my inclusion
04/07/2021, 13:40 - Qck: I am absolutely livid
04/07/2021, 13:41 - James: üòÇ I would love to see that. Next time we'll lobby for both of us to get an invite Sam, their reign of terror needs to come to an end
04/07/2021, 13:42 - Qck: If not we'll make our own karaoke but with blackjack and hookers
04/07/2021, 13:42 - Qck: And more than one giraffe mask
04/07/2021, 13:42 - James: I'm pretty sure their's had blackjack, and depending on how much Mike had to drink, he might have become a hooker
04/07/2021, 13:43 - Qck: My rage is building once more
04/07/2021, 15:08 - Mike: When the covid restrictions end I will place every event possible into this chat, until then its need to know invites only

04/07/2021, 18:55 - Kirky: the brownie from that cafe was shit
04/07/2021, 19:28 - Dayle: The tomorrow war is turning out to be a wicked film.
04/07/2021, 19:51 - Noone: CS anyone? me and Misto steal your girl are waiting to play
04/07/2021, 19:51 - Dayle: Hmmm

04/07/2021, 20:00 - Kirky: Yea
04/07/2021, 20:01 - Kirky: Gluten free. Like what's even the point of living without gluten? Texture was awful.
04/07/2021, 20:08 - Wezz: goo-ton free?
04/07/2021, 20:08 - Dayle: üò±
04/07/2021, 20:08 - James: fruten gree

04/07/2021, 20:12 - Wezz: Fuck, even the Kid's mocking me
04/07/2021, 20:52 - Paul: Can anyone else confirm that a duvet is like a usb stick? No matter which way you put it it's always got the buttons/zip at the top near you even after you've tried both ways
04/07/2021, 22:49 - Dayle: <Media omitted>
04/07/2021, 22:49 - Lockers: I like the buttons to be head end
04/07/2021, 22:50 - James: No, just look what you're doing Paul
04/07/2021, 22:50 - James: You're a sociopath
04/07/2021, 22:51 - Lockers: Milk then hot water too...
04/07/2021, 22:51 - Dayle: Thats bizarre
04/07/2021, 22:59 - Derren: https://youtu.be/C2cMG33mWVY?t=38
04/07/2021, 23:12 - Wezz: Wasn't expecting that, blast from the past.
05/07/2021, 07:26 - Paul: I look at the usb too and still get that wrong somehow
05/07/2021, 09:34 - Mike: <Media omitted>
05/07/2021, 09:37 - James: That's interesting, I imagine it would be they were asked to comment right? Other option is maybe they need to let large companies know if they are going to do a segment specifically on them to make sure the facts are right?
05/07/2021, 09:39 - Paul: Maybe it got leaked to them
05/07/2021, 09:44 - Wezz: Quite often news pundits reach out to orgs for their comments before release. That's why you get the whole: "Nandos did not comment". Probably a legal definition around that too
05/07/2021, 09:44 - Mike: Possible, feels shady
05/07/2021, 09:47 - Wezz: Defo feels shady, it's a company telling its employees "what you need to do". I love how they brand their Comms "Medium" spicy though.
05/07/2021, 09:47 - Nathan: We had the same with the BBC watchdogs section regarding Aldi a few years ago. Assume they have to notify us if they are planning on filming on location?
05/07/2021, 09:47 - Nathan: GDPR and all that
05/07/2021, 09:47 - Wezz: What was the BBCs problem with Aldi?
05/07/2021, 09:48 - Nathan: Just the rise of Aldi and how we were able to grow so quickly in a difficult sales time for most food retailers
05/07/2021, 09:48 - James: Extra Hot spicy news, there is an active shooter, so make sure your orders are fulfilled nice and quickly
05/07/2021, 09:48 - Nathan: A few negatives but mainly a positive spin on us as a business
05/07/2021, 09:49 - Wezz: Good good. Wondered what Aldi had done, only really heard decent things.
05/07/2021, 09:51 - Wezz: Pew pew, üå∂Ô∏èextra spicy alert üå∂Ô∏è Our CEO is down. Have you tried our new Ch'ckn Strips? Made from sugar salt and lard! Pew pew
05/07/2021, 09:53 - James: ü•≠Mango and Limeü•≠ alert everyone! Nando's has successfully transitioned through the hostile takeover. Please ignore all previous messages about active shooters, and respect your new gun wielding overlords.
05/07/2021, 10:00 - Mike: üçã Lemon & Herb üçã alert!

05/07/2021, 12:42 - Dayle: i do remember wanting them salt and vinger crisps in the sweetshop.
05/07/2021, 12:45 - Wezz: you and nessa were ordering at the same time, think you took both right? cause the first one wouldn't let you all in
05/07/2021, 12:45 - Wezz: but lee and i bussed back
05/07/2021, 12:45 - Wezz: waiting on the invoice from our bus driver
05/07/2021, 12:47 - Lee: I legit don't remember the taxi from casino to karaoke. I don't remember getting in a taxi. Did we Uber or black cab?
05/07/2021, 12:48 - Lee: I remember arriving to the karaoke in the taxi, because we won the race.
05/07/2021, 12:48 - Kirky: OH YEA
05/07/2021, 12:48 - Kirky: Sick taxi driver parked us closer, should've given a massive tip for that
05/07/2021, 12:49 - Mike: oh I think Nessya ordered the first cab, asked for an XL, then it turned up and could only seat 4 or something?

05/07/2021, 13:06 - Mike: "Booking type: KARAOKE 100% PMT" I think the Karaoke place literally charged us double because of the football win

05/07/2021, 13:13 - James: They are the only lines, just on repeat for an hour
05/07/2021, 13:14 - Qck: Yeah I thump the first cunt who dares mention how many lions are on our shirt, I get it, we're the four lions
05/07/2021, 13:16 - Wezz: Does this include the football bets?
05/07/2021, 13:19 - Piper: we won 50 right then what happened to that?
05/07/2021, 13:20 - Paul: Vaguely remember Derren attacking a taxi driver now that you mention it

05/07/2021, 18:37 - Derren: Must have tasted nice
05/07/2021, 18:37 - Kirky: probably tasted like coke
05/07/2021, 18:37 - Derren: You sure it wasn't mike ordering a quadruple JD and coke
05/07/2021, 18:38 - Kirky: it was a double
05/07/2021, 18:38 - Kirky: <Media omitted>

05/07/2021, 18:40 - Dayle: wait i didnt get a wiskey - was it that cunt that kept trying to fget a song? :D

05/07/2021, 18:41 - Mike: I had whiskeys
05/07/2021, 18:41 - Wezz: *Chivas Regal 12 year old Whiskey loool
05/07/2021, 18:42 - Wezz: Should get a free ball tickle at that price
05/07/2021, 18:42 - Mike: tasted a lot like watered down jd but who am I to judge such a fine establishment
05/07/2021, 18:42 - Wezz: I said it was Jack's birthday
05/07/2021, 18:44 - Wezz: What it meant was we got apple sourz and then another awful shot free? You remember the one that tasted like paint stripper at the start?
05/07/2021, 18:44 - Dayle: nope
05/07/2021, 18:46 - Lee: ¬£40 for 8 shots of apple sourz.
05/07/2021, 18:46 - Lee: Mental
05/07/2021, 18:46 - Wezz: well, it worked out ¬£40 for 16 shots, which ain't bad i guess
05/07/2021, 18:47 - Lee: Yeah, there were three rounds of shots. Sourz, Vodka, and some shit that smelt a bit like tequila.
05/07/2021, 18:47 - Wezz: Yeah, the tequila stuff was the free one
05/07/2021, 18:47 - Wezz: that came with the birthday shots
05/07/2021, 18:47 - Wezz: i'll work out the bill splits, screenshot inc
05/07/2021, 18:48 - Kirky: can just pay ¬£20 each if you want idc
05/07/2021, 18:48 - Kirky: pretty sure that last ¬£40 of shots was forced on you all by me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
05/07/2021, 18:54 - Wezz: <Media omitted>

05/07/2021, 18:55 - Mike: Clearly hadn't drank enough
05/07/2021, 18:55 - Kirky: wezz was secretly throwing them over his shoulder all night and was totally sober
05/07/2021, 18:56 - Wezz: I had to recite the order to the lady 4 times over you guys squealing Fratellis at a billion decibels
05/07/2021, 18:57 - Kirky: i take offence to "squealing"
05/07/2021, 18:57 - Qck: I don't think Jack can after my video analysis
05/07/2021, 18:58 - Qck: Most important song of the night seems to be Torn by Imbruglia, felt like everyone's aura coalesced and breathed as one in the room - I also think Wezz strained out a bit of piss during the chorus, but that's a raw performance for you
05/07/2021, 18:59 - Lee: How can it be ¬£20 each if there were 8 of us?
05/07/2021, 18:59 - Lee: Am I missing something?
05/07/2021, 18:59 - Derren: Maths
05/07/2021, 18:59 - Kirky: mikes was actually ¬£50
05/07/2021, 19:00 - Wezz: mike's was more cause he was drinking pedo whiskey
05/07/2021, 19:00 - Wezz: but he chipped in money for bets earlier
05/07/2021, 19:00 - Wezz: so really it all balances out okay.. lool
05/07/2021, 19:00 - Lee: Oh sorry, didn't realise you actually broke it down.
05/07/2021, 19:00 - Kirky: yea and minus the money i owe mike for breakfast, think its basically ¬£20
05/07/2021, 19:01 - Wezz: What can I say; getting old mate. Still young enough to jot down a nice new word when I learn one. _coalesced_  üëå
05/07/2021, 19:01 - Kirky: would it be easier i make a monzo for you guys
05/07/2021, 19:02 - Wezz: your life would be easier if you made a monzo
05/07/2021, 19:02 - Kirky: why
05/07/2021, 19:03 - Kirky: i just slap my card on the thing and it goes BEEPBEEP and i walk away with my coffee

05/07/2021, 19:14 - Lee: Gotta be fair. We can't just all invoice Dayle.
05/07/2021, 19:14 - Lockers: Pretty sure you still owe me plenty of drinking money from like 2014
05/07/2021, 19:17 - Paul: Unlucky retard

05/07/2021, 19:54 - Wezz: Wish he was transexual, then we could get TEH URN

06/07/2021, 09:44 - Noone: I've hit a serious moral roadblock. SOLO launches this Saturday and it has a language filter to not allow discussion of shit like Tiananmen square. Now, I won't ever be talking about that shit because it's an MMO, but I feel like I shouldn't support it
06/07/2021, 09:44 - James: <Media omitted>
06/07/2021, 09:48 - Mike: I can't wait for my plans to be foiled and I slap my servant Pangolin. Any idea for names?
06/07/2021, 09:50 - James: You could play up to the nervous servant aspect above, and play off their long mouth appendage, and call it Wormtongue?
06/07/2021, 10:06 - Paul: Damn Jack, you're gonna run out of things to do with all these moral quandaries
06/07/2021, 10:07 - Dayle: Paladin
06/07/2021, 10:09 - Noone: yeah probably. What should I do?
06/07/2021, 10:10 - Paul: Go vegan
06/07/2021, 10:11 - Noone: I didn't ask what was the quickest route to being a lefist faggot, I asked what was the solution to my problem
06/07/2021, 10:11 - Paul: Go vegetarian
06/07/2021, 10:14 - Mike: Buy it anyway like the morally vacuous beta cuck you are
06/07/2021, 10:16 - Qck: Doubt they're having an open dialogue on Mao's CCP in the factory your nike's are made in
06/07/2021, 10:16 - Qck: Just enjoy your faggy chink game
06/07/2021, 10:16 - Noone: I've already bought it, I would just not play it
06/07/2021, 10:16 - Mike: Damage is done then
06/07/2021, 10:16 - Paul: Then they win double
06/07/2021, 10:17 - Noone: Yeah fuck this game
06/07/2021, 11:22 - Piper: What is SOLO? A new star trek show?

06/07/2021, 12:30 - Wezz: Moomoo? We had Dayle Blitz jungle last night. I've missed league

06/07/2021, 12:57 - Kirky: "Before the Afghan army could take control of the airfield about an hour‚Äôs drive from the Afghan capital Kabul, it was invaded by a small army of looters, who ransacked barrack after barrack and rummaged through giant storage tents before being evicted, according to Afghan military officials." amazing
06/07/2021, 13:07 - Derren: üòÇüòÇ
06/07/2021, 14:03 - Qck: Feltz getting 400k a year? Not a chance in hell that would happen if I was BBC commissioner
06/07/2021, 15:32 - Noone: Those Afghan generals are going to be able to fuck as many little children as they want now, good for them
06/07/2021, 16:48 - Kirky: Woman on my collection said I'm very brown. Responded woah you cant say that. She didnt find it funny
06/07/2021, 16:48 - Kirky: üòë
06/07/2021, 16:51 - Dayle: Flirting? Haha fucked it
06/07/2021, 16:54 - Kirky: Thought old women would appreciate some gentle racism

06/07/2021, 17:20 - Wezz: What can I say, slow day at the office. Thought I'd get away with it
06/07/2021, 17:21 - Wezz: Just trying to impress Piper tbh
06/07/2021, 17:21 - Piper: manager does one nice thing and they have a parade
06/07/2021, 17:21 - Piper: what a joke
06/07/2021, 17:21 - Wezz: Looool. Glad it worked
06/07/2021, 17:22 - Piper: <Media omitted>
06/07/2021, 18:29 - Lockers: Now look who's racist
06/07/2021, 18:48 - Wezz: Lockers, why are Chinese kids so smart? Can you do something about it. Give them wrong info in school or something? It pisses me off man
06/07/2021, 18:48 - Lockers: More like give them wong info looooool
06/07/2021, 18:49 - Nathan: Direct correlation between shots consumed and intelligence. They just don't shot!
06/07/2021, 18:51 - Wezz: Wow - can you not make fun of their ranguage?
06/07/2021, 18:52 - Lockers: Not without being labelled a wacist
06/07/2021, 18:54 - Wezz: No, but seriously. The world's about equity these days. Just take some of the Chinese kids' math time and apply it somewhere else? They don't ruse out in the rong run
06/07/2021, 18:56 - Wezz: Mate, they smash the bajiu
06/07/2021, 19:08 - Paul: The average kid is probably a fair bit chinese
06/07/2021, 19:10 - Nathan: Equity or equality? Some would argue they are capitalising in equity ü§£
06/07/2021, 19:11 - Paul: Yeah we get it you did a business degree

06/07/2021, 19:24 - Wezz: If I adopt, it's gonna be a lovely little chubby Chinese boy
06/07/2021, 19:28 - Wezz: The bit is 24:00 - 27:20. Still cracks me up tbh.

06/07/2021, 19:55 - Wezz: Football hype
06/07/2021, 20:28 - Paul: Spain would have had 0 chances if Italian goalie didn't keep passing it to them

06/07/2021, 20:33 - Lockers: More like DUMBArumma
06/07/2021, 20:53 - Kirky: <Media omitted>
06/07/2021, 20:59 - Wezz: Bloody love Grealish, although moving on to bumming Southgate now.
06/07/2021, 21:34 - Noone: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjkgdqwxB0
06/07/2021, 21:42 - Paul: I think I misunderstood how the infinity bonus works
06/07/2021, 21:43 - Paul: It said for 1 match day so I thought that just meant this semi
06/07/2021, 21:43 - Paul: So my entire team is Spanish and Italian with the bonus
06/07/2021, 21:52 - Wezz: Amazing. Ahahah
06/07/2021, 21:53 - Paul: Gutted because I set up my squad to be sick for the England game
06/07/2021, 21:54 - Lockers: Dumb cunt. You thought every match day would have been for every match so far and you could change between each one?
06/07/2021, 21:55 - Paul: No I saw there was a window between the semis but I didn't realise it said substitutions not transfers so I thought I was fine
06/07/2021, 21:55 - Lockers: Stoopid
06/07/2021, 21:55 - Paul: Yeah oh well
06/07/2021, 21:55 - Paul: No catching wezz at this point anyway
06/07/2021, 21:57 - Wezz: Don't take shit from No.8 Lockers
06/07/2021, 21:57 - Lockers: Yeah I always regret doing fantasy leagues because I never pay attention. Oh well, will do the same for fpl and throw money away
06/07/2021, 21:57 - Wezz: Imagine knowing the rules, having a football degree, and still coming 8th
06/07/2021, 21:58 - Lockers: You got me m8
06/07/2021, 21:59 - Paul: Piper suspiciously quiet
06/07/2021, 22:03 - Wezz: I ordered Uber Eats Sainsburys cause they had an offer (40% off and free delivery), but then when ordering they added a "small order fee" of a ¬£5. So I kept adding loaves of bread until the small order fee disappeared.

Rafael inc with shopping and 6 loaves of bread on his moped.
06/07/2021, 22:11 - Lockers: Why would you order bread as opposed to something long lasting?
06/07/2021, 22:11 - Piper: i like bread
06/07/2021, 22:11 - Wezz: I have a freezer just for me, so will just freeze 5 loaves.
06/07/2021, 22:11 - Paul: He can use it as penicillin
06/07/2021, 22:11 - Wezz: I'm 50% bread
06/07/2021, 22:12 - Dayle: Or make vodka with it ffs
06/07/2021, 22:20 - Alex: I forgot to update my team last match day, and then I forgot this time, so I'm about to drop pretty hard
06/07/2021, 22:21 - Paul: Drop a sick beat?
06/07/2021, 22:33 - Dayle: He just punched him haha
06/07/2021, 22:35 - Qck: Kik da silva ball
06/07/2021, 22:41 - Paul: Gg
06/07/2021, 22:42 - Qck: Keeper just decided now was the time to take the knee
06/07/2021, 22:42 - Qck: At least racism lost as well I guess
06/07/2021, 22:55 - Wezz: Can we just beat Denmark tomorrow, please? That's all.
06/07/2021, 22:55 - Dayle: Easy no kap
06/07/2021, 23:04 - Derren: Put them in the freezer
06/07/2021, 23:04 - Lockers: Meanwhile on Internet explorer
06/07/2021, 23:04 - Derren: ah I didn't read all the way down at the time :(

06/07/2021, 23:09 - Mike: Lol
06/07/2021, 23:12 - Wezz: Wtf lool, you only getting the captcha noise part? That's freaky
06/07/2021, 23:14 - Mike: I think its saying some other numbers that also act as the code but it took me like 5 listens to guess at that, if you're hard of sight enjoy that ear rape
06/07/2021, 23:16 - James: Yeah, it's saying 31508 etc with scrambled noise to avoid voice recognition, it sounds trippy though
06/07/2021, 23:19 - Lockers: I genuinely can't hear the numbers
06/07/2021, 23:21 - Mike: Its really difficult to parse, I would not expect anyone having to do that task to enjoy it at all. It infuriated me that I gave up and recovered my account another way
06/07/2021, 23:21 - Mike: so much that*
06/07/2021, 23:22 - Wezz: Never pressed the audio captcha before, always assumed it just read the visual one but with noise in the bg. Didn't know it was its own code. Cool
06/07/2021, 23:22 - Mike: Yeh and you have to be fucking Daredevil to decipher it
06/07/2021, 23:31 - Lee: lol
07/07/2021, 08:47 - Mike: idk who faze clan is but this is a pretty interesting video on the SaveTheKids scam crypto coin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv6ne6VQCZI&ab_channel=Coffeezilla
07/07/2021, 09:34 - Noone: Lool
07/07/2021, 09:39 - Wezz: Lol watched this few days ago. Mistos fave guy SomeOrdinaryGamer did a vid too. Ricegum always been endorsing dodgy stuff.
07/07/2021, 09:44 - Noone: Love seeing these videos, imagine being one of the morons who bought this shit
07/07/2021, 09:45 - Mike: Lucky I still got my kony2012 armband
07/07/2021, 10:26 - Wezz: üçãüåø Lemon and Herb alert üåøüçã fuck you
07/07/2021, 10:26 - Dayle: ü§£ü§£
07/07/2021, 10:33 - Derren: Mutahar!
07/07/2021, 10:34 - Derren: I only linked him cos of valorant thing
07/07/2021, 10:36 - Paul: Just a reminder that this coming Saturday is international "shit on Jack Noone's head" day. Shops have stocked up on funnels
07/07/2021, 10:37 - Wezz: I thought the nation agreed on sharing one funnel?
07/07/2021, 10:38 - Paul: Yeah England did. This reminder was more for us continental folk
07/07/2021, 10:55 - Paul: <Media omitted>
07/07/2021, 11:37 - Wezz: Boiling lobsters alive will be banned in the UK under plans being drawn up by ministers to strengthen the welfare rights of crustaceans and molluscs.

The government is preparing to recognise that lobsters, crabs, octopuses , squids and other invertebrates feel pain as part of legislation that will formally acknowledge that animals are sentient beings.
07/07/2021, 11:43 - Paul: Good shit, about time
07/07/2021, 11:43 - Paul: baby steps
07/07/2021, 11:56 - Noone: Lol just try and stop me
07/07/2021, 11:56 - James: Jack you're all talk, you'd take one look at it and go all Homer Simpson and adopt snippy and read him bedtime stories
07/07/2021, 11:57 - Paul: It's never too early for a Simpsons reference
07/07/2021, 11:58 - Noone: Only bug men torture animals before eating them. The farther from the chinks we are the better, WHO'S WITH ME?
07/07/2021, 12:08 - Wezz: It's weird. Cause farther usually for literal distance. Whereas further is for figurative distance.

I think your racism justifies either spelling.
07/07/2021, 12:10 - Paul: yeah _that_ is the weird part about Jack's comments
07/07/2021, 12:16 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
07/07/2021, 12:17 - Wezz: Defo had a mini lol here btw, forgot we're announcing
07/07/2021, 12:19 - Paul: workshop = be considerate of others and their choices, you don't have to agree with their decisions, but every human deserves respect if they aren't hurting anyone. Ok job done, see you all next time
07/07/2021, 12:19 - Kirky: ORGANISED BY GUYS? DROPPED
07/07/2021, 12:20 - Wezz: Workshop = hurr durr free time off work
07/07/2021, 12:20 - Paul: or that lol
07/07/2021, 12:27 - Wezz: Only people who turn up to the workshop are BLT+.

It's a beautiful echo chamber, in isolation from the CIS men, when I can feel resentfully justified in people not _understanding_ me.

Hopefully BLT+ catches on
07/07/2021, 12:28 - Paul: christ what's the fucking point then, just a big circle jerk
07/07/2021, 12:29 - Wezz: Organisation seen as inclusive ‚úÖ
07/07/2021, 12:29 - Mike: I'd love to go to a BLT+ event, discuss why it's the best sandwich
07/07/2021, 12:30 - Wezz: We can all share our own idea of what the *+* encompasses?

Mayo? Sure
Anchovies? Fuck off
07/07/2021, 13:25 - Paul: no
07/07/2021, 13:55 - Wezz: Bigot
07/07/2021, 14:01 - Derren: <Media omitted>
07/07/2021, 14:01 - James: What in the unholy pizza mash fucking soup is that?!
07/07/2021, 14:15 - Wezz: Some weak ass gravy you got there
07/07/2021, 14:21 - Mike: Mate I was actually planning to go to Portobello just for it two days ago
07/07/2021, 14:22 - Derren: The liquor is a bit light tho :(
07/07/2021, 14:23 - Derren: My sister asked them for a cup of chilli vinegar but they sold her a bottle instead for 2 quid
07/07/2021, 14:24 - Mike: should just pass it around the shop, what tight bastards
07/07/2021, 14:24 - Derren: Got it take away init
07/07/2021, 14:24 - Derren: Asked to have it in the cup like they give the sauce
07/07/2021, 14:24 - Derren: but they sold a bottle instead xD
07/07/2021, 14:48 - Kirky: looks horrible, but the kind of horrible that would be delicous
07/07/2021, 14:55 - James: I'm not sold, it still looks foul
07/07/2021, 14:58 - Kirky: https://youtu.be/4yDEkcsL9Eg come support the soulless bug men and get banned for talking about tiananmen square with jack dayle misto and me
07/07/2021, 15:03 - Mike: Looks like guild wars 2
07/07/2021, 15:04 - Kirky: somehow the cinematic looks less fun than the actual game
07/07/2021, 15:05 - Mike: Somehow I don't believe you

07/07/2021, 15:50 - James: Don't you just hate the internet?
07/07/2021, 15:53 - Mike: Imagine looking at the England team with a shot of winning something in forever and then letting your racism win over your love for a shit sport, tweeting should be pay per character
07/07/2021, 15:53 - James: There should be a twitter aptitude test, and if you don't pass, you think you've passed, and you can tweet at bots about your shitty opinions
07/07/2021, 15:54 - Paul: When do we tell James that he failed the test and we're all bots
07/07/2021, 15:56 - James: I know you're not a bot as a bot would eventually contribute something meaningful by accident
07/07/2021, 15:56 - Paul: Damn bro this is why you're the S tier and I'm a lowly D
07/07/2021, 15:59 - James: <Media omitted>
07/07/2021, 16:01 - Paul: Right but you've gotta maintain quality James you can't just be putting edgy anime gifs and expect points
07/07/2021, 16:01 - Dayle: NANAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
07/07/2021, 16:02 - James: It's from some top tier anime though Paul, you can't tar all shows with the same degenerate brush
07/07/2021, 16:03 - Paul: Too late

07/07/2021, 16:19 - Mike: Super mobile stealther, I'm taking a month off

07/07/2021, 16:20 - Mike: Nerfed*
07/07/2021, 16:25 - Kirky: resurects allies if he kills whoever killed them :^)
07/07/2021, 16:25 - Wezz: W - Going Rogue
Passive: When enemy champions kill one of Akshan‚Äôs allies, they are marked as Scoundrels. When Akshan gets a takedown on a Scoundrel he gains bonus gold, all allies killed by the Scoundrel are resurrected at their base, and Scoundrel status is removed from all other enemies.

Active: Akshan becomes camouflaged for a short duration, or indefinitely while near terrain. During this time, Akshan can see trails leading toward Scoundrels and gains move speed and mana regeneration while moving toward them.
07/07/2021, 16:25 - Wezz: Why is that all one spell
07/07/2021, 16:26 - Wezz: Invis and res ON A W?
07/07/2021, 16:26 - Wezz: E - Heroic Swing
Akshan fires a hookshot that embeds in the first terrain hit. While embedded, he can recast to swing around the terrain in the cast direction, firing physical damage bullets at the nearest enemy while swinging. While swinging, he can recast again to jump off in the direction of the cursor and fire a final shot.

Heroic Swing's cooldown resets when Akshan earns a takedown on an enemy champion.
07/07/2021, 16:26 - Wezz: Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
07/07/2021, 16:27 - Kirky: "Heroic Swing's cooldown resets when Akshan earns a takedown on an enemy champion." hi another tristana
07/07/2021, 16:27 - Wezz: Throw in some cdr reset for fun
07/07/2021, 16:28 - Kirky: imagine making some sick play, get a quad with 1 hp left, he comes out of stealth, 1 taps you, and all his team respawns
07/07/2021, 16:28 - Kirky: LMAO
07/07/2021, 16:28 - Wezz: It's so dumb. Ult seems like Lucian except it locks on, and he can swing+move like luc
07/07/2021, 16:30 - Wezz: I'm glad League is finally playing with respawn timers, but should be for all champs. DotA style buybacks.
07/07/2021, 16:31 - Kirky: yea buyback is cool
07/07/2021, 16:31 - Wezz: I swear we wouldn't lose with Piper if he could buy back
07/07/2021, 16:31 - Kirky: apart from "DONT FIGHT FOR 5 MINUTES I NEED TO FARM BUYBACK"
07/07/2021, 16:31 - Paul: Fuck man I reckon he'll be a direct counter to zephyr too
07/07/2021, 16:32 - Wezz: Riot "We made Akshan as a early to mid game champ"
07/07/2021, 16:32 - Wezz: HE RES'S THE TEAM
07/07/2021, 16:32 - Kirky: wtf
07/07/2021, 16:33 - Kirky: he only res the people his kill killed, and after that cant anymore
07/07/2021, 16:33 - Kirky: could be kinda fun i guess, pick out who killed your carry
07/07/2021, 16:34 - Kirky: but late game is always one person getting a triple+ a lot of the time xDD
07/07/2021, 16:34 - Wezz: yeah, the ability just says "takedown".
07/07/2021, 16:34 - Wezz: So he only has to assist them to get the res
07/07/2021, 16:34 - Kirky: oh what
07/07/2021, 16:34 - Wezz: Dude, champ is perma invis if he's next to terrain too,
07/07/2021, 16:35 - Kirky: yup
07/07/2021, 16:35 - Kirky: many fun
07/07/2021, 16:35 - Kirky: another greaty yuumi champ no doubt
07/07/2021, 16:35 - Wezz: bonus gold for killing, nice early->mid game champ
07/07/2021, 16:35 - Kirky: üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüëåüëåüëå
07/07/2021, 16:36 - Wezz: At least make him melee or something.
07/07/2021, 16:42 - Kirky: ikr, gonna be broken as it is cause hes NEW
07/07/2021, 16:46 - Wezz: Apparently, Ultimate Spellbook might release tomorrow. That game mode where you get a random (you pick) additional ult.
07/07/2021, 16:47 - Kirky: oh sick
07/07/2021, 18:07 - Piper: when can bring only farm champ out?
07/07/2021, 18:08 - Kirky: isnt that sivir?
07/07/2021, 18:08 - Piper: no cos has to not top damage
07/07/2021, 18:08 - Kirky: Q = line of farm
W = bouncy bouncy farming happy face
E = GO AWAY LET ME FARM
R = RUN TO THE FARM
07/07/2021, 18:09 - Kirky: idk what your passive is but i assume its just farm related
07/07/2021, 18:09 - Piper: no its run faster related
07/07/2021, 18:10 - Piper: sivirs w hits champions
07/07/2021, 18:10 - Piper: so not farm only
07/07/2021, 18:12 - Kirky: oh you mean literally not allowed to hit champs?
07/07/2021, 18:12 - Kirky: would you funnel all the gold to your team in this utopia of yours?
07/07/2021, 18:15 - James: No, just hoard it like a dragon
07/07/2021, 18:26 - Wezz: Piper atop a huge mountain of coins. We're all fighting with sticks and tattered cloth.
"Sir, can we please have some coin?"
No ü§ë

07/07/2021, 21:24 - Wezz: It's tiiiiiime
07/07/2021, 21:24 - Wezz: Although saka and sterling been amazing. Kane kinda lost his mojo a bit
07/07/2021, 21:26 - Wezz: Fucking Grealish time boys. One hand on my beer, one hand on my testicles.

07/07/2021, 22:00 - Wezz: This reminded me of that advert when we went into lockdown about domestic violence increase.

Poster said "domestic violence _always_ works from home"

Spooked me and stayed with me.

07/07/2021, 22:56 - Lockers: He's applied the use of var wrong. He said it's not clear and obvious and then suggests looking at the screen
07/07/2021, 22:57 - Wezz: Yeah, you tell him Lockers!
07/07/2021, 22:57 - Paul: It's the mistake that needs to be clear and obvious, isn't it?
07/07/2021, 22:58 - Paul: He means that from the refs perspective it wasn't a clear call. But with VAR it's a clear and obvious error
07/07/2021, 22:58 - Derren: He said it wasn't clear for the ref
07/07/2021, 23:00 - Lockers: Sorry yeah, but that's still not the role of var

11/07/2021, 20:34 - Mike: Poll question: would you rather play Goal Keeper and the Queen is going to take a penalty against you, or would you rather take a penalty with  the Queen as Goal Keeper?
11/07/2021, 20:37 - Qck: Obviously you take the Queen as a keeper, stutterstep so she stumbles and then aim a powershot at the moneymaker as she's labouring back to her feet
11/07/2021, 20:38 - Qck: I would want the new 20 pound note to commemorate the shiner I gave her
11/07/2021, 20:38 - Mike: It's a solid tactic
11/07/2021, 20:39 - Mike: I'd want it to commemorate my absolute toe punt as her head is separated from her shoulders
11/07/2021, 20:39 - Qck: Treason! HIGH TREASON!
11/07/2021, 20:39 - Qck: Guards!

11/07/2021, 21:12 - Kirky: and if they lose?
11/07/2021, 21:14 - Mike: I'll go to Leicester square and smash something
11/07/2021, 21:28 - Lee: Oh well boys, it was fun while it lasted.
11/07/2021, 21:28 - Mike: Yep we had a good run
11/07/2021, 23:12 - Kirky: SOMEONE FUCKING CRYING OUTSIDE MY HOUSE
11/07/2021, 23:12 - Kirky: LMAO
11/07/2021, 23:15 - Bayley: F
11/07/2021, 23:20 - Paul: Southgate is legit shit. He's carried by an incredible and expensive team. Makes absolutely dogshit decisions whole tournament. Change my mind
11/07/2021, 23:21 - Lockers: Germany game. Approach to penalties is poor, sure. But disagree
11/07/2021, 23:22 - Paul: He refuses to use half his world class players and his sub timings are abysmal
11/07/2021, 23:23 - Alex: He has a 19 year old playing like shit and decides to give him the most important penalty?!?!?!?!
11/07/2021, 23:23 - Paul: Not gonna pretend I know as much as you. But it seems evident that you don't sit back and park the bus after a goal in the first 2 minutes and refuse to make subs for 50 years. And then when you finally do you sub on someone supposedly injured instead of your pros
11/07/2021, 23:24 - Alex: Southgate set the team up ok, but too defensive and then after that every decision was late and poor
11/07/2021, 23:25 - Alex: You could see from the beginning of the second half we needed another sub and yet while we were winning he seemed to be ready to take us to pens, yet when we get there  he had no plan. That was saka's first penalty, what the fuck southgate
11/07/2021, 23:26 - Paul: Even ignoring the penalties why are we getting to 2nd half of extra time with still like 3 substitutions left. No other team were doing that.
11/07/2021, 23:27 - Paul: Carried by sick premier league superstars.
11/07/2021, 23:27 - Lee: Thin margins, boys.
11/07/2021, 23:28 - Lee: But I agree
11/07/2021, 23:28 - Paul: Yeah was just annoying though. He gets a lot of praise
11/07/2021, 23:29 - Alex: We had the easiest run in the world cup and fucked it and the easiest run here and still fucked it against a team we should beat. He has fuck all experience at any competent level. He got relegated with Middlesbrough as manager. that's it
11/07/2021, 23:29 - Lee: Imagine someone saying 'hey, you're gonna go to penalties and Pickford is gonna save two. But you're still gonna lose'
11/07/2021, 23:31 - Paul: Lmao
11/07/2021, 23:32 - Noone: Our black players let us down this game, change my mind
11/07/2021, 23:32 - Kirky: <Media omitted>
11/07/2021, 23:33 - Noone: UH OH
11/07/2021, 23:37 - Lockers: Nah you're right, Germany, Czech Republic and Croatia are easy. Only took Spain to pens and knocked a very impressive Netherlands side out
11/07/2021, 23:37 - Paul: Yeah I don't really agree with the easy path thing
11/07/2021, 23:37 - Lockers: I agree that he was too complacent with the substitutions tonight. Too stubborn
11/07/2021, 23:38 - Paul: Yeah I think stubborn is right
11/07/2021, 23:39 - Noone: I'm just glad everyone had fun
11/07/2021, 23:39 - Noone: Although driving back home after that game was scary, lots of angry drivers and police cars
11/07/2021, 23:40 - Lockers: Can we remove @447850499652 please

12/07/2021, 12:59 - Noone: I think anorexic meant something different back then
12/07/2021, 13:00 - Paul: nah its basically the same idea, its called infantile anorexia nervosa, its food refusal, but obviously the psychology is different

12/07/2021, 15:31 - Wezz: Even though it's next door I've never actually been. Tate Modern gives you LSD sheet with every family ticket

12/07/2021, 19:30 - Wezz: What am I looking at here? Are they breaking into Wembley through a side door? And the fans are fighting them back?

12/07/2021, 20:20 - Noone: This wasn't he Italy game lol, the amount of misinformation around this video
12/07/2021, 20:21 - Noone: this is the last game they played in Wembley, Eng vs Den?
12/07/2021, 20:26 - Wezz: How are you sure it's from the Denmark game? That's nuts if so.

The funny thing is, it's even been cropped on Italian news sites to make it seem racist. (https://www.la7.it/intanto/video/vergogna-a-wembley-tifosi-italiani-malmenati-dagli-inglesi-12-07-2021-390086)

BuT mY aGeNdAs!!
12/07/2021, 20:28 - Wezz: You know no one's fact-checking either... just fueling the fire. Media loves it.
12/07/2021, 20:29 - Paul: I meant in the semis
12/07/2021, 20:29 - Paul: Just saying it's a regular occurrence
12/07/2021, 20:31 - Wezz: But what you linked was just the English hating those that disrespect our great love of queues. Is *not* racially provoked violence.
12/07/2021, 20:32 - Wezz: Can look on Instagram for all the edgelord racists lol
12/07/2021, 20:32 - Paul: Yeah on 2nd watch it was definitely both sides getting whacked. But my point is that this isn't the only occurrence of English hooligans beating up foreign fans
12/07/2021, 20:39 - Wezz: Yeah, I suggest watching it again with loud audio and listen to everything. These are people without tickets barging into the stadium and bypassing security. Some English fans decided to 'help' the stewards by blocking the entrance and attempting to stop any that breach. Hence the "do your job" at the end too.

Using it to incorrectly fuel racial divide is the real shame. Cause you know if we _barely_ managed to fact check it, there's no hope for non-football fans. Not calling you out, just the bs media loves these opportunities.
12/07/2021, 20:43 - Paul: I didn't even watch it with sound tbf but yeah you're right
12/07/2021, 20:58 - Wezz: Most news sites are the same:
"Racial abuse" - Instagram shots of edgelords posting monkey emojis
"Violent attacks" - video of fans response to a security breach at Wembley
"Bottles thrown" - pre-game Lecister square English idiots throwing bottles into the air and letting them fall for 'fun'.

Put it all together and you get:
*Racist English fans throwing bottles and inciting violence as Italy win Euro finals*

13/07/2021, 18:28 - Qck: Hmm is it not safe for a train tho
13/07/2021, 18:29 - Paul: It's shaky cam footage of guys being gunned down after surrendering so you be the judge
13/07/2021, 18:30 - Kirky: you watch it loudly, and laugh while shouting allah akbar
13/07/2021, 18:30 - Qck: Can't believe they haven't invested in a steadicam yet
13/07/2021, 18:34 - Mike: Fought for 2 hours and ran out of bullets, that's pretty nutty
13/07/2021, 18:38 - Wezz: God is great
13/07/2021, 18:40 - Wezz: God is _great_
13/07/2021, 18:41 - Paul: Yeah same
13/07/2021, 23:36 - Mike: Just finished love death and robots S2, big let down sad season compared to one. Would not recommend.
13/07/2021, 23:37 - James: It was fine, wasn't as good as the first for sure, but there was some cool episodes
13/07/2021, 23:38 - Mike: Name one
13/07/2021, 23:40 - Alex: Most of them?
13/07/2021, 23:40 - Alex: Especially pop squad
13/07/2021, 23:41 - Alex: Snow in the desert and life hutch were meh, but the others were really good
13/07/2021, 23:44 - James: I enjoyed the childless one, and the drowned giant for sure. I liked snow in the desert as well.
13/07/2021, 23:45 - Qck: i like the one where my uncle steve comes down the chimney and gives the children a present with his mouth
13/07/2021, 23:45 - Mike: That's pop squad, didn't feel very unique to me but it was probably one of the better eps
13/07/2021, 23:46 - Alex: I didnt dislike any of them, but the two I mentioned were the "worst" for me. Loved the christmas one and the first one
13/07/2021, 23:47 - Qck: yeah the only one i didn't care for was the michael b. jordan one where he reaches peak uncanny valley with his weird cg face
13/07/2021, 23:47 - Alex: This season felt more bearable for those uncanny valley faces
13/07/2021, 23:47 - Qck: also now remembering back to my uncle steve and the tongue gifts, i don't think that's a positive memory so maybe i didn't enjoy that episode either
13/07/2021, 23:47 - Alex: Depends, were you naughty?
13/07/2021, 23:48 - Qck: lets take it to pm üòâ
13/07/2021, 23:48 - Qck: mike you can pm me too you bad boy
13/07/2021, 23:49 - Qck: james, i don't mind the photo but there's a reason why i explicitly didn't ask you to pm me
13/07/2021, 23:50 - Mike: If you're naughty you get eaten and processed into presents for the good kids
13/07/2021, 23:51 - Mike: Not the kind of eaten you probably got from Steve
13/07/2021, 23:51 - Alex: It makes me feel better that there is so kind of justice system in the world and if I ever get bored of this life thing I can shoplift and a creature will come and sort me out
13/07/2021, 23:52 - Qck: question for chat: what was the last item you shoplifted?
13/07/2021, 23:54 - Mike: If you want to go out you don't need a cosmic monster bud, I'll do it for free with a Piper's üèè
13/07/2021, 23:54 - Mike: Maybe sweets when I was young, most recently stolen item was a watch though
13/07/2021, 23:54 - Alex: I do like cricket.... but I dont want to give you the satisfaction, maybe I'll hold a competition
13/07/2021, 23:55 - Mike: Charity Auction?
13/07/2021, 23:57 - Qck: the last big item i stole was a 25 pound beauty kit from boots for my mum on her birthday when i was 16

the last item i stole was some strawberry laces from tescos, i don't know why i did it but i did it and that was a year ago
13/07/2021, 23:58 - Qck: nobody had the gall to stop me with my laces and it was blatantly done in the biscuit aisle with cameras hot on my tail
13/07/2021, 23:59 - Mike: He's a thief with a heart of gold and a stomach of laces
14/07/2021, 00:00 - Qck: in fairness there were beauty kits there for 10 pound, 15 pound and even 20 pound...s
14/07/2021, 00:01 - Qck: but she's an ugly fucker so i thought i'd get her something nice
14/07/2021, 00:07 - Piper: The drowned giant was the worst
14/07/2021, 00:25 - Mike: I think it was one of the better but okish overall
14/07/2021, 00:34 - James: You can't stop me though
14/07/2021, 00:35 - James: I stole sweets as a kid, pushed it one day and took a Max power car magazine and got caught by the guard, put me on the straight and narrow
14/07/2021, 00:35 - James: Was probably about 8-9?
14/07/2021, 00:39 - Mike: Always knew you were rotten
14/07/2021, 08:40 - Derren: <Media omitted>
14/07/2021, 09:19 - Paul: I've never shoplifted but I've been arrested for shoplifting and spent 4 hours in a jail at age 10
14/07/2021, 09:20 - Mike: Likely story, criminal scum
14/07/2021, 09:26 - James: Everyone in here is innocent you know
14/07/2021, 09:29 - Paul: They even confirmed with CCTV that I didn't steal anything, but said it was possible I could have been the "look-out". I didn't even know they were stealing üòü
14/07/2021, 09:30 - James: I would have negotiated for a deal, and thrown the others under a bus, got into witness protection as a French prostitute named Labelle, fallen in love with a brutish artist that could never quite find his break, and jumped from the Eiffel tower to escape a loveless marraige
14/07/2021, 09:31 - Paul: Yeah that was plan B but then my mum came and picked me up
14/07/2021, 09:32 - Lockers: Never
14/07/2021, 09:32 - James: That just made me do like a proper mutley laugh and then I realised I wasn't muted on Teams
14/07/2021, 09:32 - Paul: Do you know something I don't?
14/07/2021, 09:33 - Lockers: Your reputation
14/07/2021, 09:33 - Lockers: Never associated with you to others during my time in planet thanet
14/07/2021, 09:33 - Paul: True, I was always throwing gang signs and such
14/07/2021, 10:18 - Derren: https://youtu.be/x2w-tbUBgN4
14/07/2021, 10:18 - Derren: Imagine getting shit on that hard by this guy
14/07/2021, 10:31 - Wezz: I'm told I stole a kinder egg from Superdrug when I was ~7 with my aunt. Didn't tell her.

She only noticed when I opened it outside and made me go back and apologise to the cashier lady and pay for it. I cried
14/07/2021, 10:37 - Wezz: Friend used to weigh things as onions in the supermarket.

Tresemme shampoo? 33p of onions.
Couple bags of haribo? 7p of onions
14/07/2021, 10:38 - Wezz: Whole receipt used to say:
Onions
Onions
Onions
Onions
Onions
Onions
Onions
Onions

He hated the Sainsbury's near him cause they didn't help in his feed the homeless campaign. Apparently was his way of revenge.
14/07/2021, 10:41 - Paul: Did he give the shampoo and haribo to the homeless?
14/07/2021, 10:41 - Mike: No he gave them onions, keep up Paul
14/07/2021, 10:42 - Paul: HE DIDN'T BUY ONIONS MIKE FFS
14/07/2021, 10:43 - James: His receipt says otherwise Paul
14/07/2021, 10:43 - Paul: this is outrageous, it's unfair!
14/07/2021, 10:43 - Mike: Why would he give homeless people haribo and shampoo? Ridiculous, they need good hearty onions
14/07/2021, 10:44 - Paul: Mike says this with a mouth full of onion no doubt
14/07/2021, 10:47 - James: As god intended
14/07/2021, 10:57 - Mike: <Media omitted>
14/07/2021, 11:01 - Derren: This shit is so boring
14/07/2021, 11:09 - Wezz: It was his weekly shopping the time I was there. The homeless campaign thing seemed like some backwards justification for his onion actions. It's also true though, Pret gave all their sandwiches/pastas at the end of each day to him to disperse to the homeless. But Sainsbury's used to put them in the dumpster
14/07/2021, 11:10 - Paul: Yeah a lot of supermarkets still do that. Same with e.g. Amazon expired products
14/07/2021, 11:10 - Paul: Capitalism BABY
14/07/2021, 11:10 - Mike: In fairness Sainsbury would then offer the sandwiches in the bottom of the bin to the strongest hobo, thereby ensuring good genes.
14/07/2021, 11:11 - Wezz: Well, this was 10 years ago. Since then there's been a few lawsuits that have placed indemnity on the company disposing of the produce.
14/07/2021, 11:11 - Paul: A lot of that was EU law though, not UK
14/07/2021, 11:11 - Wezz: Hence why they now make them inedible before disposing and all that mad shit.
14/07/2021, 11:12 - Paul: It's basically the perfect example of what's wrong with the world imo
14/07/2021, 11:12 - Wezz: You'll be pleased to know many stores ignore those company policies
14/07/2021, 11:13 - Paul: Yeah I'd imagine a lot of individual franchises have hearts until they get caught and hushed aside
14/07/2021, 11:14 - Wezz: Company is obviously concerned about precedent set in courts. But min wage employees don't care. And we get this lovely loop of kindness at most places.
14/07/2021, 11:15 - Paul: The company line is always about liability, but in reality it's to keep up any faux scarcity, especially when it's non-produce products
14/07/2021, 11:16 - Mike: Scarcity lost by feeding those super poor homeless who would otherwise be sandwich buyers?
14/07/2021, 11:16 - Paul: Non-produce products is the real offender here
14/07/2021, 11:17 - Paul: are*
14/07/2021, 11:17 - Wezz: So true with high end products
14/07/2021, 11:17 - Wezz: Yeah if I was homeless with ¬£5er I'd buy a posh cheese and pickle
14/07/2021, 11:17 - Paul: It's the same concept with planned obsolescence
14/07/2021, 11:19 - Mike: New political party? Posh Cheese & Pickle UK?
14/07/2021, 11:19 - Mike: Better than BNP I spose
14/07/2021, 11:19 - Wezz: Food should be redistributed where possible. It's a simple discussion üòÇ
14/07/2021, 11:20 - Paul: But think of the poor profits!
14/07/2021, 11:20 - Mike: Woah hold up there, I struggle for my post cheese and pickle. Why's scummy Steve get it for free?
14/07/2021, 11:20 - Mike: Posh*
14/07/2021, 11:20 - Paul: Get this socialism OUT OF MY CHAT
14/07/2021, 11:20 - James: Yeah, food should be a right, luxury food can be different, but food that is otherwise going to be thrown away is no longer luxury
14/07/2021, 11:21 - Wezz: Yeah, could talk about that shit forever. Reason I grew up hating Apple
14/07/2021, 11:21 - Mike: Luxury food can be ground into chicken nuggets, all free food is nuggets.
14/07/2021, 11:22 - Mike: "what nugget did you get today Steve?"

"Think mine was baked beanz nugget"
14/07/2021, 11:22 - James: We're on step away from food pills of the future
14/07/2021, 11:22 - Paul: Is this like some kind of profit value perpetual motion device
14/07/2021, 11:22 - Wezz: But it's been going on for years before. Remember reading about light bulb company buying long lasting filament technology and keeping it under wraps. Ain't no one paying 200¬£ for a lightbulb. But they'll pay 2¬£ X 100
14/07/2021, 11:22 - James: one*
14/07/2021, 11:23 - Paul: Yeah that's one of the easiest examples to show people, same with batteries
14/07/2021, 11:24 - Mike: Fuck your pills, give the poor nuggets or give them death I'll train them to say with my variety box of nuggets
14/07/2021, 11:25 - Paul: You can get Usain Bolt to endorse this company
14/07/2021, 11:25 - Mike: Are you allowed to hold a patent and not use it?
14/07/2021, 11:25 - Mike: Feel like that's kinda against the spirit of it lol
14/07/2021, 11:25 - James: But why would anyone use it is the point, it's not profitable
14/07/2021, 11:25 - Wezz: Get into Right to Repair too. Plus annual perpetual upgrades, iPhone battery court case, heavy lean on advertising
14/07/2021, 11:26 - Wezz: In your words:

Oh Mikey, you sweet summer child
14/07/2021, 11:27 - Paul: It starts to get a bit conspiracy territory when you think about pharmaceuticals though. Get's a bit scary
14/07/2021, 11:31 - Wezz: Totally agree. Not always the case though, companies afraid of damaging brand value. E.g. fashion, super posh things are limited edition/seasonal and will never be reduced. Would sooner burn the clothes.
Then middle class stuff gets distanced from the brand e.g.  main retail to outlet
14/07/2021, 11:32 - Mike: Np, turn those Burberry jeans into nuggets
14/07/2021, 11:33 - James: Bah god he's onto something
14/07/2021, 11:34 - Wezz: Loool. I'm down, let's reshape our unneeded food before redistribution. It'll help maintain social hierarchy. Also add a bit of sewage in the process while we're at it.
14/07/2021, 11:34 - Mike: What you don't know is I've just got a secret vendetta against Jamie Oliver and want to make him cry at every opportunity.
14/07/2021, 11:35 - James: It's hardly a secret
14/07/2021, 11:35 - Wezz: Mike, I need you to sit on all these Posh Cheese and Pickles before we give them away.
14/07/2021, 11:35 - James: Plus, he's already proven that if you show children their nuggets are made of crap, they still want to eat them. Nuggets are the answer
14/07/2021, 11:35 - Paul: This wouldn't be far off reality of food that was distributed for free. It would need to be made deliberately worse than even the cheapest option
14/07/2021, 11:36 - Mike: <Media omitted>
14/07/2021, 11:36 - Tapan: So I double checked and Sainsburys does actually support food donation. They've got docs and guidelines on how to donate surplus/food that's going to go to waste and set up contracts for that sort of stuff. There's something here suggesting that they want all stores to participate but there doesn't seem to be a target date for this and it looks like it's an individual store's responsibility to set this up
14/07/2021, 11:37 - James: Get out of here with your facts Tapan, we're bringing down the system
14/07/2021, 11:37 - Paul: Good PR move if nothing else by them
14/07/2021, 11:37 - Wezz: 100%. I think nuggets are actually a superior shape for consumption. Need to make them spikey nuggets. Or just blend it all into slop
14/07/2021, 11:38 - Mike: Are Sainsbury's stores franchised? Why would it be left to individuals?
14/07/2021, 11:40 - Mike: Na nuggets can be handed out like treats, straight into needy hands. Slop requires bowls, or maybe cupped hands.
14/07/2021, 11:41 - Tapan: It's more about how each store is managed, there's guidelines and some standardisation but AFAIK the actual management of the store is the manager/head of that store
14/07/2021, 11:41 - Mike: Please put forward my jeans into nuggets idea for consideration
14/07/2021, 11:41 - Wezz: Solid PR that is completely unsurprising in today's environment. Back then it came down to the stores.. and unless you incentivise it, or someone is deemed responsible, it ain't gonna happen.
14/07/2021, 11:42 - Tapan: Done
14/07/2021, 11:43 - Tapan: Yeah that's the problem, it's left up to an individual basis so depends on how much time a manager wants to put into it
14/07/2021, 11:44 - Wezz: Also feel like stores are a little fucked if they do fucked if they don't tbh. If they do 'ohhhh great advertising ploy, virtue signalling monopolous pricks". If they don't "this is an abomination, you are throwing food away infront of all these starving children"
"My baby son choked on a poor cheese and pickle nuggo"
14/07/2021, 11:44 - Mike: <Media omitted>
14/07/2021, 11:45 - Paul: Those poor giant monstrous corporations
14/07/2021, 11:46 - Mike: Also falls onto the minimum wagies to deal with it lol
14/07/2021, 11:47 - Mike: "hey guys here's more work so those over there without jobs get fed, anyway don't forget to close up at 2am"
14/07/2021, 11:48 - Tapan: I mean CEOs gotta have his private jet somehow. Now back to work, peasant.
14/07/2021, 11:49 - Paul: Also, if you try to discuss your wages we'll fire you, and we'll blackmail you into not unionising. Anyway, I'm off in a rocket LOL
14/07/2021, 11:50 - James: Again though, aren't we passing the buck? If we want it determined by each company, of course they'll do the minimum. Isn't the solution to have some sort of legislation to enforce this sort of behaviour?
14/07/2021, 11:50 - Tapan: Yeah there really needs to be a law about firing and rehiring with lower wages. Like wtf is going on there
14/07/2021, 11:51 - Mike: Look at Mr big guberimint over here
14/07/2021, 11:51 - Mike: -5 nugget rations for you
14/07/2021, 11:51 - Wezz: Well in a working system, it should be instigated by the people/government, written into legislation E.g. all produce shops must redistribute food to these guidelines. Voted on. Then enforced by law.

Then more staff are employed, prices go up, and we all eat nuggies for tea
14/07/2021, 11:52 - Tapan: I think France does enforce the by law
14/07/2021, 11:52 - Tapan: And iirc they all have free nugs at lunch
14/07/2021, 11:52 - Wezz: You're so smart and sexy, marry me
14/07/2021, 11:52 - Paul: 100%, but even at a legislative level they will find loopholes, as a society it's important to loudly oppose unethical behaviour. Finding a way to set a precedent will help on the legislative level as well.
14/07/2021, 11:53 - Paul: But it's against a companies incentives in our society to be ethical. Which is the root of the problem on so many levels
14/07/2021, 11:53 - Paul: But it's also important (for most companies) to publically appear ethical
14/07/2021, 11:54 - Mike: <Media omitted>
14/07/2021, 11:54 - Wezz: Your take flummoxes me. They're not *against being ethical*. They're *FOR PROFIT*.
14/07/2021, 11:54 - Paul: Is this your app company?
14/07/2021, 11:54 - Paul: I didn't say they are against being ethical
14/07/2021, 11:55 - Paul: I said acting ethically is at odds with their incentives, those arent synonymous
14/07/2021, 11:58 - Paul: Said another way: If a company is *FOR PROFIT* it's in their best interest to be unethical
14/07/2021, 11:58 - Mike: Will be once I sue them for using my NUGS patent
14/07/2021, 12:20 - Wezz: I get you, just comes off as a silly gripe to me. If a company is for profit they're for profit. If they're unethical they need to be regulated. Regulations need constant review to assess efficacy. The very nature of capitalism is competitive and we know it leads to dispossession over time. It's on us to address that in the ways we can; e.g. voting legislation, buying choices, rioting, eating the rich, whatever. It's not perfect but yet to hear a better option...and like a nug made from 100% meat, I'm all ears.
14/07/2021, 12:24 - Wezz: We can also incentivise companies to develop in publicly identified areas of concern.
E.g. space programs with tax breaks üöÄ TO THE MOON ELON LOL
14/07/2021, 12:27 - Paul: There are plenty of different branches of alternatives to capitalism that are well regarded and economically viable though? You don't need to delve too far into the literature to find really convincing and well designed ideas by revered economists I don't think it's a silly gripe to suggest that our society is built on a necessity for profits and greed and that you're either forced (but nature of the system) to play along, or otherwise suffer the consequences of attempting to not play along. Even the most stringent left wing economists say you'd be foolish to attempt to run a company in our capitalist world and attempt to NOT follow the core tenants of capitalism
14/07/2021, 12:29 - Mike: Sorry who was talking about meat NUGS???
14/07/2021, 12:34 - Mike: Because my work laptop was damaged I had to give the IT team my nandos login, unfortunately my password was P00psHoop#Wh00p and now I can never show my face in office again
14/07/2021, 12:38 - Kirky: Atleast it isnt racist
14/07/2021, 12:46 - Qck: what was the last thing you stole kirky?
14/07/2021, 13:01 - Derren: yo girl
14/07/2021, 13:07 - Kirky: A 90p malteser bunny from Tesco by accident
14/07/2021, 13:07 - Kirky: Put it in my pocket so I could put the lid on my coffee and forgot
14/07/2021, 13:07 - Qck: and that's the story you're sticking to still?
14/07/2021, 13:08 - Kirky: Yea need a good excuse for such a risk manoeuvre
14/07/2021, 13:36 - Wezz: 90p? They were robbing you mate
14/07/2021, 13:36 - Kirky: "My child has periods but is not female" thanks radio 2
14/07/2021, 13:36 - Kirky: Exactly
14/07/2021, 13:57 - James: Cartman?
14/07/2021, 14:16 - Wezz: "it's in their best interest to be unethical". It's like you imagine big fat men in top hats looking down and staying "I want to see humans suffer". Whereas it's simply profit driven. Some successful businesses offer ball tickles with a 100% free trade oat milk latte for ¬£5 and do alright.

We can see modernisation of this in today's transparent corporate charitable response to social media backlash. If it's lawful and turns profit, you can be sure that they're doing it. Their track history shows they don't care either way.

If you want all corporations to care about people to a specific degree, then you enforce it by law. Alongside existing VAT, corporation tax, etc.

Just be careful not to do it too much faster than neighbouring countries, cause the orgs move out and our national economy üìâ
14/07/2021, 14:17 - Wezz: I've done about two hours work today, its great. Enjoy a chat
14/07/2021, 14:20 - Mike: Does it need to be "grind up the poor" comments or does "can I get away with this?" Also count?
14/07/2021, 14:21 - Wezz: It needs to be "here's 5k Sam, look over there for a couple months"
14/07/2021, 14:23 - Mike: Overt corruption then, explicit laws in place etc.
14/07/2021, 14:24 - Wezz: If it was one individual then I can totally see where the malice and emotional response comes from. But in reality it's boards of directors, investors, employees.. and en entrenched culture of competitive profiteering that runs through all companies.
14/07/2021, 14:25 - Wezz: You address that shit with public backlash -> legislation -> heavy fines
14/07/2021, 14:32 - Wezz: I guess Paul holds companies accountable more than I do. I just see them as profit machines. Get lots of em in your country and you make more off tax plus increase job market competitiveness for your citizens. If there's a social concern it should be addressed by elected officials e.g. MPs/government using tax.

And there will always be new social concerns and inevitable dispossession. So these discussions will never end üôè
14/07/2021, 14:35 - James: I think Paul protests capitalism too much, I think he's a double agent for the 1% here to disrupt the conversation with ridiculous claims like abolish currency and 99% taxes
14/07/2021, 14:38 - Wezz: I'm just glad, someone like Elon Musk, can work 100000000x harder than me and earn appropriately
14/07/2021, 14:42 - James: You did admit to doing 2 hours of work earlier, whereas I just checked Elon's timesheet and he's already clocked 200000000 hours today
14/07/2021, 14:44 - Paul: No I'm not at all. My whole point is that they are victims to the same capitalist system and would be fools to not follow incentive based profit seeking.
14/07/2021, 14:44 - James: See, Paul thinks the CEOs are victims
14/07/2021, 14:44 - James: Case closed
14/07/2021, 14:44 - Wezz: _swoon_
14/07/2021, 14:45 - Paul: Reeeee
14/07/2021, 14:47 - Wezz: Glad we both agree that companies exist to make money over everything and  responsibility lies with the .gov. Can we move away scapegoating capitalism for human fallacies now ü§≠
14/07/2021, 14:49 - Wezz: Jack needs to buy his next 500hp car so he can look cool stuck in London traffic
14/07/2021, 14:49 - Paul: No it's YOU who agreed me ME bitch
14/07/2021, 14:49 - James: agreed me ME
14/07/2021, 14:49 - Paul: Fuck
14/07/2021, 14:54 - Wezz: Great, so back to your question qck, I steal the human rights of my employees daily and would like to repent
14/07/2021, 15:02 - Wezz: I say "repent" I mean fly into space in my rocket üöÄ
14/07/2021, 15:03 - Qck: I think maybe we should go back to using rocks and shells as currency, although I am typing this currently on my giant hoard of rocks and shells
14/07/2021, 15:05 - James: He wants to depose of the current 1% so he can replace them
14/07/2021, 15:05 - James: Unbelievable
14/07/2021, 16:10 - Derren: <Media omitted>
14/07/2021, 16:13 - Qck: My currency is more lethal than your currency when thrown so be wary of your words
14/07/2021, 16:14 - Qck: Who's topping the Spellsword Demon Destruction Rankings?
14/07/2021, 16:15 - Derren: <Media omitted>

15/07/2021, 01:09 - Mike: I cute came
15/07/2021, 14:05 - Mike: Had my first code cause problems in production with live customers, cya job
15/07/2021, 14:06 - Dayle: Yikes, feature?
15/07/2021, 14:07 - Mike: Not a new feature but improving an old one, no tests caught it and no reviews before it went live üòÇ
15/07/2021, 14:07 - Dayle: Blame devops and the deployment pipeline then simple haha
15/07/2021, 14:07 - Dayle: How bad was it and did they roll back quickly?
15/07/2021, 14:11 - Mike: Not bad, it's for the beta and impacted maybe 30 customers. People who ordered from beta and then needed a refund basically, delayed their refund by about 2 days so they'll never know lol
15/07/2021, 14:34 - Qck: now in non-nerd talk what did you do mike
15/07/2021, 14:34 - Qck: did you set the price of chicken to -1 pound
15/07/2021, 14:35 - Mike: Wrote code that meant if you ordered nandos delivery from Wandsworth nandos this week and needed a refund, I delayed your refund by 2 days.
15/07/2021, 14:35 - Mike: PURPOSEFULLY, FUCK YOU
15/07/2021, 14:36 - Qck: fuck sake that's definitely my nandos, and wandsworth would definitely have some filth trying to scam out a refund from you
15/07/2021, 14:36 - Qck: surprised a spicy alert wasn't put out regarding the furore over your mistake
15/07/2021, 14:39 - Qck: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqZeIVOivXw&t=57s

i don't watch speedruns as my mental illnesses don't align with that particular community, but the first few minutes of this one is insane enough for me to cut off my cock and balls and demand people call me janet
15/07/2021, 14:40 - James: Sounds like QAs fault, or maybe the BA didn't say it shouldn't be delayed by 2 days
15/07/2021, 14:41 - Qck: quality assurance and er bastard assurance?
15/07/2021, 14:42 - James: Business analyst
15/07/2021, 14:45 - Mike: I've got BA, pays out when Qck visits me
15/07/2021, 14:46 - Qck: trying to imagine shaking hands with someone and introducing myself as a business analyst, i think roleplaying as dimble is less of a stretch
15/07/2021, 14:46 - Qck: also starting to feel quite queasy
15/07/2021, 14:47 - Mike: Possessing the bodies of enemies.. speed running has gone too far
15/07/2021, 14:52 - Qck: he turns himself into a phantom lmao
15/07/2021, 15:00 - Alex: Are you saying dimble isnt a business analyst?
15/07/2021, 15:42 - Wezz: Ask Derren before you dive in dick first, he speedran a Chinese jumping game for a week and we almost lost him
15/07/2021, 15:43 - Wezz: Sounds like I ordered 12 chickens from Wandsworth yesterday and still haven't received my refund.
15/07/2021, 15:48 - Wezz: We have "Finance Analysts" in the NHS. Never been so underwhelmed, couldn't analyse a turnip. Barely use a computer.
15/07/2021, 15:49 - James: Yeah but half the people who works for the NHS have just been there for 20 years and will never been fired
15/07/2021, 15:49 - Wezz: What analysis are you going to perform with an abacus and post-it notes that's going to justify your job title
15/07/2021, 15:49 - Wezz: True. I've been here 10 years. At 40 years we get a tea towel, looking forward to that
15/07/2021, 15:53 - James: Nearly there! Towels in chat soon chaps
15/07/2021, 15:53 - Dayle: <Media omitted>
15/07/2021, 15:54 - Kirky: We dont even get an embossed metal badge anymore. What incentive do I have to stay here all my life
15/07/2021, 15:54 - Wezz: Was hoping they'd bring it forward because of the pandemic. They actually pushed it back from 20 -> 40. Really lit a fire under me üòé

15/07/2021, 15:55 - Wezz: Can't you get big union boys to bring it back?
15/07/2021, 15:56 - Kirky: Nah the big guys are running around confiscating guns rn
15/07/2021, 15:56 - Wezz: I was hoping you've leave that badge to me in your will... It's why I've been friendlier that normal
15/07/2021, 15:57 - Wezz: Smelt them into badges I bet
15/07/2021, 16:12 - Paul: Which community do they align with out of curiosity?
15/07/2021, 16:23 - Paul: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/15/kremlin-papers-appear-to-show-putins-plot-to-put-trump-in-white-house
15/07/2021, 16:25 - Wezz: Speaking on QCK's behalf, quite a few actually:
Cucks R Us
Failed Comedians
Malnourished Orphans
'i own an audio mixer so I'm cool'
/R/FashionReps
Dye my hair don't care
TransBlack

To name the main ones
15/07/2021, 16:26 - Paul: Sorry no my question was badly put
15/07/2021, 16:27 - Wezz: They're his main diagnoses
15/07/2021, 16:27 - Paul: This is a meta joke for Qcks benefit. I liked your list
15/07/2021, 16:28 - Qck: If I was Dayle I'd be fucking out of here
15/07/2021, 16:28 - Paul: There is a brief psychological assessment of Trump, who is described as an ‚Äúimpulsive, mentally unstable and unbalanced individual who suffers from an inferiority complex‚Äù.
15/07/2021, 16:30 - Mike: <Media omitted>
15/07/2021, 16:31 - Wezz: NB: I didn't attack your food. You eat scallops and drink juice, most redeeming qualities
15/07/2021, 16:32 - Qck: Cucks R Us - only been cheated on twice and watched a man fuck my partner once from a closet, so that's a no
Failed Comedians - implies there was ever the option to succeed so that's a win
Malnourished Orphans - having the same bodyfat percentage as a niger refugee doesnt mean i'm malnourished you fat fuck
'i own an audio mixer so I'm cool' - i don't own one of these so that's an L for you still
/R/FashionReps - you're thinking of jack noone and his jeans
Dye my hair don't care - we're all getting older mate, have to try and fight the greys somehow
TransBlack - the idea of being either makes me feel physically sick and violent to boot
15/07/2021, 16:33 - Qck: so i shan't allow it
15/07/2021, 16:33 - Qck: all slander
15/07/2021, 16:34 - Paul: You're just convincing me more that you're a transblack malnourished cuck

15/07/2021, 16:37 - Qck: you've made it up kiddo
15/07/2021, 16:37 - Wezz: TransBlack; I was going with born white, turned black. Little dig at your music and fashion preferences. And your black dick
15/07/2021, 16:38 - Paul: Ah shit has his dick atrophied again?

15/07/2021, 16:41 - Qck: it doesn't matter if simpson man says it
15/07/2021, 16:41 - Wezz: Nah Mike, Sainsbury's were trying to look out for all the Vegans in the world. They were sneaking in protein in the form of pork and beef to ensure appropriate macros are met despite their morale dilemmas - Tapan
15/07/2021, 16:41 - Paul: Blasphemy!
15/07/2021, 16:41 - Qck: simpson man says a lot of silly things, if i ever see you say and how again i'm honestly gonna go berserk

15/07/2021, 19:32 - James: Yeah, at least put a butterfly chicken on your head to be on brand
15/07/2021, 19:37 - Wezz: Just hit them with a "Medium Spicy Alert" beforehand and it'll go down swell

18/07/2021, 13:41 - Derren: Michael Jackson?

18/07/2021, 14:35 - Lee: That guy gets everywhere
18/07/2021, 14:36 - Wezz: Can't believe the crews are still wearing bodysuits, must be sweating their balls off

18/07/2021, 15:18 - Alex: So what do people think, racing incident or penalty?
18/07/2021, 15:19 - Wezz: Think it's all the radio messages saying Hamilton is at fault for the crash
18/07/2021, 15:20 - Wezz: Don't boo too loud; you might faint
18/07/2021, 15:20 - Mike: Radio hating on Hamilton, crowd says boo

18/07/2021, 15:23 - Lockers: Same
18/07/2021, 15:23 - Wezz: Oh, I'm watching a stream of F1TV
18/07/2021, 15:23 - Alex: A lot of people on reddit saying the production problems as well
18/07/2021, 15:25 - Mike: The problem with Hamilton is he always tries to race it in

18/07/2021, 15:29 - Alex: It showed that both could have done a few things there to avoid and didnt. If max slows and lewis goes through everyone would say that was a great overtake
18/07/2021, 15:29 - Alex: Why are you like this?
18/07/2021, 15:30 - Wezz: Best tickets ever holy shit. Is that what's left of Max's car?

18/07/2021, 15:32 - Lee: True blue
18/07/2021, 15:33 - Lee: I'd quite like Lewis to get a stop and go though. Would put Lando into 3rd.

18/07/2021, 16:01 - Mike: Those last two boys, stop they're already dead
18/07/2021, 16:01 - Mike: Are they actually going to get lapped?
18/07/2021, 16:10 - Wezz: HERE COMES HAMILTON
18/07/2021, 16:11 - Wezz: I think it usually happens!
18/07/2021, 16:12 - Mike: Leclare's car cutting out repeatedly, here comes Lewis
18/07/2021, 16:15 - Lee: Lol
18/07/2021, 16:17 - Lee: That's Lando fucked.
18/07/2021, 16:17 - Alex: My boy üò≠üò≠
18/07/2021, 16:24 - Mike: I'm actually on fire, kill me and any of my unknown bastard children
18/07/2021, 16:27 - Alex: Can nobody pit properly today?! üòÇ
18/07/2021, 16:32 - Lee: Can Bottas just fuck off so we can have a Ferrari and two brits on the podium?
18/07/2021, 16:33 - Mike: Bottas is Nessya's favourite, I specifically bought a verstappen hat to spite her and now I'm 40 quid down and sad
18/07/2021, 16:33 - Alex: üá¨üáßüá¨üáßüá¨üáß
18/07/2021, 16:34 - Alex: That's like your favourite food being rice
18/07/2021, 16:34 - Mike: Funny you should say that
18/07/2021, 16:45 - Lee: <Media omitted>
18/07/2021, 16:45 - Wezz: Love this from Hamilton
18/07/2021, 16:45 - Lee: *it's
18/07/2021, 16:48 - Wezz: Bottas needs to seeth himself into the tyres or something
18/07/2021, 16:49 - Lee: Come on then Hamilton. Let's do this.
18/07/2021, 16:50 - Alex: People on reddit very salty about Hamilton, fuck em, win sum fackin races hamilton
18/07/2021, 16:50 - Lee: He's a second faster a lap
18/07/2021, 16:50 - Lee: But once you get in that dirty air it's just so hard.
18/07/2021, 16:51 - Alex: This race has been pretty shit with how hot it is. I'd hate to be one of the people stuck at the track in this weather
18/07/2021, 16:52 - Lee: Yeah, imaging paying to die in the sun watching cars go around one corner.
18/07/2021, 16:52 - Alex: I can see every corner on TV, I'd hate to only be able to see one
18/07/2021, 16:57 - Mike: CMON HAMILTON
18/07/2021, 16:58 - Lee: COME ON
18/07/2021, 16:58 - Lee: UNBELIEVABLE
18/07/2021, 16:58 - Wezz: IT'S HAMMER TIME BABY
18/07/2021, 16:58 - Mike: SCORED A FUCKING GOOOAAALLL
18/07/2021, 16:59 - Lee: What a drive.
18/07/2021, 17:00 - Wezz: OMGG
18/07/2021, 17:01 - Lee: On your fucking feet Mikey boy
18/07/2021, 17:03 - Lee: Track invasion!
18/07/2021, 17:14 - Mike: Too weak from the heat, can barely invade the toilets
18/07/2021, 17:20 - Wezz: Is that a live national anthem?
18/07/2021, 17:24 - Lee: Red Bull getting zero points is savage.
18/07/2021, 17:24 - Alex: Perez was pretty wank today
18/07/2021, 17:25 - Wezz: Perez got fastest lap I think... does that count?
18/07/2021, 17:26 - Wezz: Will they do the sprint thing next Saturday too?
18/07/2021, 17:26 - Lee: No
18/07/2021, 17:26 - Alex: No, have to be top 10 to get the point, was just to take form Hamilton
18/07/2021, 17:26 - Lee: Just for three races
18/07/2021, 17:26 - Lee: Not sure what the other ones are
18/07/2021, 17:26 - Alex: At two more races this season, one of them will be monza
18/07/2021, 17:27 - Lee: Horner so butthurt over the crash
18/07/2021, 17:27 - Lee: Shitting on Hamilton
18/07/2021, 17:27 - Alex: Coming with the idea that Hamilton shunted max when it was a racing incident
18/07/2021, 17:28 - Lee: 'I hope he's happy'
18/07/2021, 17:28 - Lee: Jesus
18/07/2021, 17:29 - Wezz: Guys, you should never put a wheel in at Copse corner...
18/07/2021, 17:29 - Wezz: Even I know that
18/07/2021, 17:29 - Alex: Hamilton overtook there 2 more times in the race
18/07/2021, 17:32 - Wezz: LeClerc was terrified with lunatic Hamilton on the inside
18/07/2021, 17:35 - Alex: Leclerq gave him space and then caught those rumble strips wrong
18/07/2021, 17:44 - Wezz: Some solid side by side going on

18/07/2021, 20:39 - Mike: Flooding hell? That's a paddling
19/07/2021, 09:45 - Paul: Too soon man. Germany is half under water
19/07/2021, 09:51 - James: Digging under the ocean was always a favourite of mine too, draining it to some weird desert that just ends with an invisible wall
19/07/2021, 09:52 - James: Then making the shitty angler live next to the dystopian hell ocean I've just created
19/07/2021, 09:52 - Dayle: ü§£ü•≤
19/07/2021, 10:00 - Paul: Bipolar?
19/07/2021, 11:07 - James: Nah, he just appreciates some hearty Terraria shenanigans
19/07/2021, 11:08 - Dayle: Honestly really enjoying it aint done fuck all on it really just running around digging
19/07/2021, 11:10 - James: It's fun to explore everywhere, but once that runs dry I'd recommend looking up a checklist of boss progression, as half the game is locked behind hardmode and beating a specific boss, and you have to do certain things to carry on the game that isn't really signposted very well
19/07/2021, 11:26 - James: https://www.carlsguides.com/terraria/walkthrough/progression.php This was the one I used
19/07/2021, 11:26 - Dayle: Ah thanks dude ill check it out ty ty

19/07/2021, 12:50 - Noone: UH OH
19/07/2021, 14:32 - Paul: Mike/Derren do you remember the ec*k forums?
19/07/2021, 14:43 - Lockers: Even I remember those
19/07/2021, 14:48 - Dayle: 39 days until im in majorca lads lets fucking go
19/07/2021, 14:48 - Dayle: fuck this too hot english weather
19/07/2021, 15:01 - Noone: sorry mate we're not allowed in Europe, back to Margate
19/07/2021, 15:25 - Derren: I don't think I went on them often as I wasn't posting
19/07/2021, 15:26 - Noone: why? does it turn out it was some kind of terrorist training forums or something
19/07/2021, 15:49 - Paul: It just suddenly dawned on me how there was a gigantic jailbait subforum that was super popular and how creepy that is in retrospect
19/07/2021, 15:56 - Lockers: Wasn't there someone on there renowned for being a bit... Creepy?
19/07/2021, 16:01 - Wezz: Times were so different. Was sent a college humor vid from 8 years ago (https://youtu.be/_QyYaPWasos)

I mean, it wasn't good then, was mediocre mainstream internet comedy. But now it wouldn't even fly
19/07/2021, 16:03 - Qck: dugg down cos it sucks
19/07/2021, 16:08 - Noone: That song was great, shoot binladen too real wtf was with all those ads
19/07/2021, 16:09 - Lockers: Your opinion is wrong, this is a classic
19/07/2021, 16:15 - Wezz: You two plain Jane (Jacks)
19/07/2021, 16:15 - Wezz: Caused me some crazy reminiscing.
19/07/2021, 16:34 - Paul: I still sing these lyrics over the original
19/07/2021, 16:39 - Paul: Probably quite a few tbh

tHIS KIDS A NOOB FAG
YOU'RE A FAG
YOU'RE A BITCH
ALL YOU GUYS CAN SUCK MY DICK
19/07/2021, 17:36 - Noone: CHRIST THAT'S DISGUSTING
19/07/2021, 17:40 - Wezz: Arthroscopy is super interesting, what i'll say is, imaging doesn't always equate to condition. Some people will have no cartilage on an x-ray and be fine, no pain. Others will have crazy fibrous cartilage and also be fine.

One of the studies we reference for justifying an invasive surgical sham was actually a knee arthoscopy study. They put patients in two groups, active patients received arthroscopic meniscectomies whereas for the others they just made the incision and took images inside without performing the procedure itself.

They found no difference between the groups.
19/07/2021, 17:41 - Wezz: The study: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1305189
19/07/2021, 17:58 - Dayle: So my calf just popped walking up the stairs I don't have much pain when using the ball of my foot but can't tiptoe remedies go
19/07/2021, 18:00 - Lockers: Go to the physio
19/07/2021, 18:02 - Qck: Lose some weight
19/07/2021, 18:08 - Dayle: Thanks cunt
19/07/2021, 18:09 - Dayle: I mean like wrap it or heat or what got some smart cunts in here
19/07/2021, 18:10 - Lockers: RICE
19/07/2021, 18:10 - Lockers: Although consider intermittent heat/ice on it to improve blood flow
19/07/2021, 18:10 - Lockers: But genuinely, if it "popped", get to the physio
19/07/2021, 18:11 - Dayle: Ta
19/07/2021, 18:14 - Lockers: I assume you know what rice stands for?
19/07/2021, 18:14 - Dayle: Yeah ty
19/07/2021, 18:16 - Mike: You put it in a box of rice like a soggy iPhone
19/07/2021, 18:22 - Lockers: Wacist
19/07/2021, 18:29 - Qck: Rest, Overcome, Conquer, Adapt
19/07/2021, 18:29 - Paul: Regional income cat eater
19/07/2021, 18:30 - Mike: https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-proof-of-full-vaccination-to-be-made-mandatory-for-entry-to-nightclubs-from-end-of-september-12359283
19/07/2021, 18:30 - Qck: That's assistant TO the regional income cat eater
19/07/2021, 18:36 - Mike: Interesting that a negative test won't be enough, pretty much forces you to be vaccinated or lose a part of life
19/07/2021, 18:36 - Lockers: Wow you're really dumb
19/07/2021, 18:37 - Wezz: Fake ID and fake vaccination records?
19/07/2021, 18:38 - Qck: God and you've dealt with some really thick kids
19/07/2021, 18:38 - Dayle: I think if they get a genuine nhs tracker that uses the qr code you get from the nhs app it will be fine
19/07/2021, 18:38 - Dayle: <Media omitted>
19/07/2021, 18:38 - Wezz: Scary stuff, not a fan tbh. Should leave it to the venues.
19/07/2021, 18:39 - Dayle: It is scary af
19/07/2021, 18:40 - Wezz: Yeah I assume they will. Nhs app already set-up for event qrs
19/07/2021, 18:41 - Lockers: I'm impartial at the moment, yet to see a strong argument either way
19/07/2021, 18:42 - Alex: I like it, france very similar. Either be vaccinated or have a negative PCR test (which you will need to pay for)
19/07/2021, 18:45 - Qck: Yeah I can't say I give a fuck personally, yeah it's weird and dystopian but I also don't wanna get the coff because gary from wigan is down for his 30th
19/07/2021, 18:45 - Mike: Also means if you can't medically get a vaccine you can't go to any large events from now on, period
19/07/2021, 18:45 - Wezz: What medical reason prevents vaccination?
19/07/2021, 18:46 - Qck: These are bubble boys that aren't going anywhere anyway though
19/07/2021, 18:48 - Mike: Guess it depends on the vaccination mostly
19/07/2021, 18:49 - Wezz: I mean, argument for is pretty simple: better societal protection against COVID. Argument against is a bit more complicated but mostly infringing on freedoms.
19/07/2021, 18:50 - Qck: Implying there's any form of freedom in the UK
19/07/2021, 18:50 - Wezz: Genuinely interested as I dont really know of any. Sure if you can prove that you can't for X reason you'd be fine.
19/07/2021, 18:50 - Mike: Yeh, throw in the usual slipper slopes of where does it end and you've got ot
19/07/2021, 18:51 - Wezz: I just see a lovely happy medium here til things cool down. Where some businesses run COVID vaccines only clubs. And others run dirty clubs full of sexy street urchins.
19/07/2021, 18:51 - Qck: I remember that one barmy cunt who kept going on about milk in the commons said he'd wait for his vaccine orally as he's needlephobic
19/07/2021, 18:52 - Wezz: I know which one I'm going to
19/07/2021, 18:52 - Qck: For all the milk stuff he was preaching turned out he was pure soyboy
19/07/2021, 18:55 - Wezz: You still upset they won't let you marry your father? üëÄ
19/07/2021, 18:55 - Qck: I took out a superinjunction so nobody would know of this, expect a letter from my lawyers
19/07/2021, 18:59 - Wezz: I just fathomed a guess, either that or your love for FGM
19/07/2021, 19:00 - Paul: Weak ass bitch
19/07/2021, 19:02 - Dayle: What do you think the maximum amount of people speaking aloud a word you used at the same time?
19/07/2021, 19:03 - Paul: Has anyone ever been as far as do want etc
19/07/2021, 19:03 - Wezz: Imagine not having a strong argument about mandatory vaccination
19/07/2021, 19:03 - Wezz: Mandatory morning shit. Mandatory butter on toast. Fuck off lockers
19/07/2021, 19:04 - Wezz: Probably something like Allah during prayer times
19/07/2021, 19:04 - Dayle: Thats a mad amount of Allah's actually
19/07/2021, 19:06 - Paul: I think more likely skadouche
19/07/2021, 19:09 - James: I was think WHEYYY when someone fucks up on Live TV
19/07/2021, 19:12 - Wezz: So we have:
1. Skadouche
2. Wheyyy
3. Allah

Good luck with your assignment Dayle
19/07/2021, 19:43 - Qck: national anthem during the superbowl surely

19/07/2021, 19:43 - Qck: our one that is
19/07/2021, 19:45 - Lee: https://youtu.be/QtDPQQQWP_M
19/07/2021, 19:45 - Lee: Pretty mental from this perspective.
19/07/2021, 19:47 - Lockers: Yeah fuck off lockers
19/07/2021, 19:49 - Qck: didn't schumacher intentionally crash into damon hill to similarly make sure he won the championship
19/07/2021, 19:49 - Qck: so is it okay if hamilton does it
19/07/2021, 19:50 - Qck: also those cars are fucking FAST
19/07/2021, 19:51 - Lee: I'm not a massive fan of Hamilton, but he didn't do it intentionally.
19/07/2021, 19:52 - Lee: Mental. Apparently one of the fans had to be treated after being hit by flying debris.
19/07/2021, 19:54 - Qck: then explain why he was penalised? huh? huh, lee, huh? huh? go on, let's hear it, huh, hUh HUH
19/07/2021, 19:59 - Lee: Often in sport, when you make a mistake, you get penalised.
19/07/2021, 20:00 - Qck: name another
19/07/2021, 20:00 - Qck: tennis
19/07/2021, 20:00 - Qck: yeah you're right, sorry
19/07/2021, 20:08 - Paul: Jokes on you
19/07/2021, 20:10 - Qck: there's no need for this sort of abuse
19/07/2021, 20:11 - Wezz: Crazy camera angle. Wish it happened at Copse Corner. How fast he's going when he hits the barrier jeeze
19/07/2021, 20:14 - Wezz: I meant Chapel.. üôÑ
19/07/2021, 20:53 - Piper: Allergies
19/07/2021, 20:54 - Wezz: Allergic reactions
Most people with allergies (including food or penicillin allergies) can be vaccinated against COVID-19.

Tell healthcare staff before you're vaccinated if you've ever had a serious allergic reaction (including anaphylaxis). They may ask what you're allergic to, to make sure you can have the vaccine.

Serious allergic reactions to the COVID-19 vaccines are very rare.

If you do have a reaction, it usually happens in minutes. Staff giving the vaccine are trained to deal with allergic reactions and treat them immediately.

If you have a serious allergic reaction to the 1st dose of a vaccine, you should not have the same vaccine for your 2nd dose.
19/07/2021, 21:29 - Piper: its a bit more difficult than that
19/07/2021, 21:30 - Piper: the hospital has created a new allergy covid advice and guidance service
19/07/2021, 21:30 - Piper: and it is HEAVING
19/07/2021, 21:31 - Mike: Is that just worried people or people who have had serious issues? Because ones serious and the others a supply issue
19/07/2021, 21:32 - Piper: na some are serious
19/07/2021, 21:32 - Piper: people ringing saying all my friends have had 2 vaccines and i can't.. and i gta be like massive demand
19/07/2021, 21:33 - Piper: wont be for like 3-4 months before we respond
19/07/2021, 21:34 - Piper: the dissapointed when youre basically saying cant go out with friends this summer ;(
19/07/2021, 21:35 - Piper: but maybe its improved since last time dno
19/07/2021, 21:51 - Paul: It's 100% hysteria
19/07/2021, 21:53 - Wezz: Don't know a tonne, but know if you're allergic to one COVID vaccine you could get a different one. They're broken into categories, e.g. mRNA, Vector, Protein subunit. So if you react to jab one you get a different one for jab two. Was one of the positive outcomes from the Mix-and-Match UK vaccine trial
19/07/2021, 21:55 - Paul: Anaphylaxis to the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines is currently estimated to occur in 2.5 to 11.1 cases per 1 million doses, largely in individuals with a history of allergy
19/07/2021, 21:56 - Wezz: Yeah, and that's likely cause it contains polyethylene glycol. Whereas the AZ vaccine doesn't so can be used as an alternative in those cases
19/07/2021, 21:56 - Paul: However, the overall risk of anaphylaxis to an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine remains extremely low and largely comparable to other common health care exposures.
19/07/2021, 21:57 - Paul: It's basically a non issue
19/07/2021, 21:57 - Wezz: Can read the BMJ's article, Key Facts (https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n120)

Also explains a reason for some of the hysteria, as MHRA came out with a statement that was later revised. The media focused on the initial statement and seemingly ignored the subsequent revision.
19/07/2021, 21:58 - Paul: https://v.redd.it/6osde6fwc7c71

19/07/2021, 22:08 - Paul: People have the power if they wield it. But don't tell Noone
19/07/2021, 22:08 - Kirky: Afaik it's actually hard asf to get fired if you dont let them. Short of criminal stuff union basically always backs you
19/07/2021, 22:09 - Kirky: Which is a shame cause me be fired would solve a lot of my problems üôàüòÇüòÇüòÇ

20/07/2021, 08:51 - Derren: ü§î
20/07/2021, 08:51 - Qck: Polish friend hand-me-downs give me a fucking break
20/07/2021, 08:51 - Qck: Get him in the chat to replace your gimpy emoji ass
20/07/2021, 08:52 - Derren: He's played league with them before
20/07/2021, 08:52 - Derren: More than you ever did
20/07/2021, 08:52 - Derren: Grumpy cunt
20/07/2021, 08:52 - Qck: Yeah get him in then, that's the only reason James is here after all
20/07/2021, 08:53 - Derren: You bored this morning Samuel
20/07/2021, 08:55 - Qck: Just don't like your conversational starters from Wojciech Grzezyszykieski
20/07/2021, 08:58 - Qck: Have to be mean on the phone to my letting agent in 5 minutes so this is good target practice
20/07/2021, 08:58 - Wezz: Can't believe you're treating Derren like this ON HIS BIRTHDAY?
20/07/2021, 08:59 - Paul: Happy birthday Derren you fat horse
20/07/2021, 08:59 - Wezz: Happy birthday big nose xx

20/07/2021, 09:00 - Derren: üßê
20/07/2021, 09:01 - Qck: It's not actually his birthday is it? Otherwise my putdowns are being put in his high IQ memory chamber and he'll bring it up for no reason 7 years later
20/07/2021, 09:01 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
20/07/2021, 09:02 - Wezz: You probably flamed me for it last year so it went in my calendar
20/07/2021, 09:02 - Qck: Happy Birthday Derren!
20/07/2021, 09:02 - Derren: You're very cute
20/07/2021, 09:03 - Wezz: Thanks bbz u2

20/07/2021, 09:29 - Derren: 30
20/07/2021, 09:29 - Dayle: nah, no way dont believe you now
20/07/2021, 09:29 - Derren: ? o.o
20/07/2021, 09:30 - Derren: Do you believe that Mike is 30?
20/07/2021, 09:35 - James: I believe Mike is a timeless entity that has existed as long as humanity has remembered
20/07/2021, 09:36 - Qck: I think Mike maybe is Time
20/07/2021, 09:44 - Paul: Does that mean Derren gets to choose the games for Friday?
20/07/2021, 10:00 - Lockers: Hb shitsto

20/07/2021, 11:54 - Mike: Lucky bastard 30th just as the restrictions end, hbbbb
20/07/2021, 11:54 - Derren: Not gonna go to a pub or out so it doesn't matter üòÇ

20/07/2021, 12:07 - James: I did üòèüòèüòè
20/07/2021, 12:07 - Lockers: Bro, we all did. At this point it's not a thing to be proud of
20/07/2021, 12:10 - James: Who says I'm proud, I'm stuck looking like this üòèüòèüòè
20/07/2021, 12:15 - Wezz: Can't believe you've done this
20/07/2021, 12:16 - Wezz: Downloading Aion...
20/07/2021, 12:17 - Derren: <Media omitted>
20/07/2021, 12:17 - Paul: I'm picking AOE2 for my bday. You wanna double down with me?
20/07/2021, 12:17 - Wezz: You wanna destroy us all at Melee for your birthday?
20/07/2021, 12:18 - Wezz: I'm picking discord soggy biscuit
20/07/2021, 12:18 - Paul: 2v2 tournament??
20/07/2021, 12:18 - Derren: There's also mario kart and bomberman too :(
20/07/2021, 12:18 - Derren: leggooo
20/07/2021, 12:18 - Derren: Me and kirky vs the rest of you
20/07/2021, 12:18 - Derren: 2vs15
20/07/2021, 12:18 - Paul: Ok I'll have drew
20/07/2021, 12:18 - Wezz: I want drew!
20/07/2021, 12:19 - Paul: It's gotta be experienced player with non experienced as a ratio of experience. So you'd get the worst teammate, kirky 2nd worst etc
20/07/2021, 12:26 - Wezz: Feel like Bomberman and Mario Kart would be sick. Would you recommend we download same emu as you (Slippi)? Where you get the roms? I can do Friday but not Saturday ü§î
20/07/2021, 12:50 - Derren: Well it's only 4 player
20/07/2021, 12:53 - Wezz: Both only 4 player?
20/07/2021, 12:55 - Kirky: <Media omitted>
20/07/2021, 12:55 - Derren: You never had a gamecube or wii?
20/07/2021, 13:04 - Wezz: No, consoles suck.

Bomberman on PC had up to 8 players üßê
20/07/2021, 13:05 - Wezz: Might choose *Uno Flip* for my birthday.
20/07/2021, 13:11 - Paul: I thought you could get way more than 4 in Mario kart with mods
20/07/2021, 13:12 - Derren: Not sure it works on emulator
20/07/2021, 15:00 - Noone: Happy birthday you fucking arab
20/07/2021, 15:02 - Derren: üòê
20/07/2021, 15:03 - Mike: Petition to start having ciestas in 25 plus degree heat
20/07/2021, 15:13 - Wezz: My balls is hot
20/07/2021, 15:13 - Dayle: Das ist gut
20/07/2021, 15:27 - Derren: Hate this fucking counties Internet infrastructure
20/07/2021, 15:27 - Derren: How can a flat that's 50m away from a telephone change not have fttp but houses a mile away have it
20/07/2021, 15:27 - Derren: Exchange *
20/07/2021, 18:07 - Paul: The fuck does this mean
20/07/2021, 18:08 - Paul: Petition to fire Mike out of a cannon into the sun
20/07/2021, 18:13 - Paul: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7H9uo3j5FQ
20/07/2021, 18:15 - Paul: I bet this sort of thing has been around long before this specific version was discovered. It's basically the sort of shit Snowden was talking about and had been rumoured for decades now. Just becomes so much more invasive since smartphones took over our lives
20/07/2021, 18:51 - Qck: first half felt like standard issue stuff but it's interesting that they target journalists with that israeli spyware specifically
20/07/2021, 18:52 - Qck: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qteWNccZvg0

in lighter news, dunkey did a video on how @447943624891 lived when he worked as an ebay seller
20/07/2021, 19:00 - Mike: Too clean to be me
20/07/2021, 20:35 - James: <Media omitted>
20/07/2021, 20:39 - Paul: He used to send me these of him beating silver's in csgo. Still a massive noob. Ignore
20/07/2021, 20:39 - James: Yeah, but that's still impressive because I'm silver
20/07/2021, 20:39 - Paul: Skill isn't relative it's a fixed scale
20/07/2021, 20:39 - Paul: Time is a flat circle
20/07/2021, 20:40 - James: You're a flat circle
20/07/2021, 20:40 - Paul: Namaste
20/07/2021, 20:40 - James: Namaste out of my way Paul
20/07/2021, 20:41 - Paul: LoL is rotting your poor, already fragile brain
20/07/2021, 20:42 - James: >implying I have a brain
20/07/2021, 20:42 - Paul: And how
20/07/2021, 20:42 - James: touch√©
20/07/2021, 22:06 - Mike: I thought this was a given for political targets and such, didn't realise it had filtered down to journalists and dissidents already. Funny thing is people say just throw away your phone but then do you ask everyone you meet to do the same? Bring a soundproof faraday cage for every meeting's phones?
20/07/2021, 22:11 - Paul: It's pretty ironic that in this emerging world of tech that the safest and most secure form of communication has gone full circle back to face to face in a dark candle lit room with no electricity
20/07/2021, 22:38 - Mike: Even then it means nothing if only a minority of people practice it, a tyrant will just use you doing so as evidence of collusion with an enemy and have you removed. All communications out in the open while you try to send smoke signals to Dave to buy midget porn
20/07/2021, 22:40 - Qck: I thought Mike was Time
20/07/2021, 22:42 - Paul: Special relativity says it's both. Imagine Mike is on a train, going half the speed of light. If he played a game of league on that train at the same time that you (standing still at the station) picked your nose. What do you think you'd both observer if the government was tracking your phones?
20/07/2021, 22:43 - Qck: i don't know paul, what would be both observer?
20/07/2021, 22:43 - Paul: You have no idea how much that annoyed me when I read it back
20/07/2021, 22:44 - Qck: jokes on you
20/07/2021, 22:44 - Lockers: *you'd both observer
20/07/2021, 22:45 - Mike: Get a load of this sheep still believing in time, bet you think Mike's a good looking guy too huh?
20/07/2021, 22:45 - Mike: *say yes, I need this*
20/07/2021, 22:45 - Qck: "what would you'd both observer?" are you unwell?!
20/07/2021, 22:46 - Lockers: You'd both observer be unwell
20/07/2021, 22:57 - Derren: https://store.steampowered.com/app/611500/Quake_Champions/
20/07/2021, 22:57 - Derren: Game for Friday?
20/07/2021, 22:58 - Paul: Oh shit let's go
20/07/2021, 23:04 - Qck: down for some blood run madness
20/07/2021, 23:26 - Paul: @447850499652 If a Westfold falls and no one is around to hear it, did it really fall?
21/07/2021, 00:08 - Noone: Where was the Westfield when the Westfield fell?
21/07/2021, 01:37 - Qck: close-by, as they're all over the shop
21/07/2021, 09:42 - Paul: Piper how would you reform prison and justice?
21/07/2021, 10:09 - Wezz: Well, you know what they say about prison and justice...
21/07/2021, 10:35 - Wezz: Is this like a Quake Valorant hybrid? I'm down
21/07/2021, 10:37 - Wezz: Also Paul is just jealous. He hasn't 20 bombed since he was 16.

Would advise you slow down progression tho, if you're better than Piper you're not allowed in the Bummers.
21/07/2021, 10:48 - Piper: not even worth thinking about tbh
21/07/2021, 10:48 - Piper: in order to reform you will have to break numerous laws and ethics to achieve anything
21/07/2021, 10:50 - James: I don't think anyone is better than Piper, I've seen him kill a man just for looking at him
21/07/2021, 10:57 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
21/07/2021, 10:57 - James: Merciless
21/07/2021, 11:02 - Dayle: Can we get this on a tshirt?
21/07/2021, 11:06 - Lockers: I think you mean THE t shirt that not everyone has received yet
21/07/2021, 11:14 - Paul: If you had full consent and could avoid all the red tape
21/07/2021, 11:22 - Mike: <Media omitted>
21/07/2021, 11:22 - Mike: fucking*
21/07/2021, 11:23 - Mike: again
21/07/2021, 12:07 - Mike: No more death sentences, instead use the condemned to test make up products instead of animals
21/07/2021, 12:53 - Wezz: I'm with Piper, if someone's 100% been caught touching kids or whatever. We bring back public Scaphism. Only for the absolute worst criminals. If you've murdered an adult go to prison. Also prison should be a power farm where everyone rides bikes to power GPUs in the neighbouring room that mine crypto that pays for the whole thing. If you don't cycle we stick stuff up your asshole until you do, figure that bit out later
21/07/2021, 12:53 - Wezz: Anddddd, go.
21/07/2021, 13:00 - James: If they don't cycle we start taking organs one by one
21/07/2021, 13:07 - Piper: lol wez i thought same
21/07/2021, 13:07 - Piper: great idea
21/07/2021, 13:09 - Piper: instead of doing nothing should be making money for government
21/07/2021, 13:10 - Nathan: Worst of the worst prisoners get thrown into a facility that has no guard presence and food and supplies are dropped in via helicopter. They are left to do what they want, weather it be murder each other or live in harmony thats up to them
21/07/2021, 13:14 - Piper: i think we can't make any reforms until we develop as a race
21/07/2021, 13:14 - Piper: people making decisions are as big as a mess as those who commit crimes
21/07/2021, 13:15 - Lockers: You're a race
21/07/2021, 13:16 - Nathan: I hear what you're saying, let's develop an AI which makes decisions for us based on the greater good? We can call it NetSky.
21/07/2021, 13:19 - Lee: I thought they already did in some prisons though?
21/07/2021, 13:21 - Piper: sweatshops
21/07/2021, 13:21 - Mike: Yeh it's worked out well for 1% of America's population loool
21/07/2021, 13:25 - Mike: I like it, all hail vice president Nathan and president NetSky
21/07/2021, 13:29 - Piper: ultimatum, slave labour or death
21/07/2021, 13:36 - Paul: Death sentence for every crime no matter how trivial
21/07/2021, 13:37 - Dayle: Watching porn in Germany is a crime kill him boys
21/07/2021, 13:37 - James: Drum and Bass is making the decisions now chaps
21/07/2021, 13:38 - Paul: Pretty sure that's UK mate
21/07/2021, 13:42 - Paul: I do love a bit of slave labour
21/07/2021, 13:43 - Paul: I'd argue they often commit the worst crimes
21/07/2021, 13:50 - Piper: i think they should just make me supreme leader, im clearly far more advanced
21/07/2021, 13:50 - Piper: ill make all the right decisions
21/07/2021, 13:50 - Piper: and ill change my name to jean-luc piper
21/07/2021, 13:50 - Piper: and lead the uss corona
21/07/2021, 13:51 - Paul: Can we, the workers, have control of the means of production under your lead?
21/07/2021, 13:56 - Mike: No
21/07/2021, 14:03 - Paul: Down with the fascist piper state!
21/07/2021, 14:05 - James: Paul, let us not take the word of a Mike to speak for the Piper, he is a false shepherd
21/07/2021, 14:45 - Paul: True. What say you oh supreme ruler
21/07/2021, 14:46 - Paul: Far too many have been led astray by the sharp tongue of Mike the black worm. Thank you for catching me before I fell for his dark power
21/07/2021, 14:48 - Wezz: As long as it's televised, I'm in.
21/07/2021, 14:50 - Wezz: Not _in_, in, obviously. I'll be placing bets and watching.
21/07/2021, 14:51 - Paul: Too late throw him in
21/07/2021, 14:59 - Wezz: Pfft, _fine_. I'll destroy these Hunger Games watching hopefuls. I watched the OG Battle Royale Japanese movies, ain't no 12A rated bullshit. I eat detonating collars for breakfast.
21/07/2021, 15:01 - Wezz: IRL would die night one from hypothermia/distress
21/07/2021, 15:07 - Mike: I think Noone would do well in the games, the men might keep him alive considering he's the closest thing to s woman they'll see in a while
21/07/2021, 15:07 - James: Plus he already doesn't trust anyone

21/07/2021, 19:30 - Wezz: Think that's Mike. This was at the SC2 Barcraft event all that time ago
21/07/2021, 20:11 - Mike: Stylish clothing, gotta be me
21/07/2021, 20:56 - Noone: No fucking way really?
21/07/2021, 20:57 - Paul: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LPiM9d5QUM
21/07/2021, 20:57 - Noone: If that's true, then that's the most impressive claim to fame any of you fossils have
21/07/2021, 20:57 - Paul: Erm, excuse me? Misto was in Funeral 2
21/07/2021, 20:58 - Noone: Yeah and I made the exact same but better frag
21/07/2021, 20:59 - Paul: Yeah and Mike made a better song than Wezz, that isn't the point, its the EXPOSURE
21/07/2021, 21:04 - Paul: Has anyone here used brilliant.org? I know it gets advertised a lot on youtube, wondered if it's actually any good. I was thinking of taking some Maths classes
21/07/2021, 21:06 - Wezz: Not tried Brilliant, was gonna sign up too. Previously used Khan Academy for Math which was really good, made learning fun. Also, CodeAcademy for coding is super good.
21/07/2021, 21:07 - Wezz: Also, how much exposure did Funeral 2 get?
21/07/2021, 21:07 - Paul: No idea
21/07/2021, 21:07 - Paul: Yeah I've used both of those before.
21/07/2021, 21:07 - Wezz: That AVGN episode's got like 6.5mil views, at least half because of my _great cover_.
21/07/2021, 21:08 - Paul: Yeah but were you in funeral 2? It was very popular on enemydown and cadred
21/07/2021, 21:10 - Wezz: I owned HLTV.org for an evening? Does that count for anything?
21/07/2021, 21:10 - Paul: I remember it fondly but no. Incidentally do you have any idea how valuable that site is now lol
21/07/2021, 21:10 - Wezz: 50p?
21/07/2021, 21:11 - Paul: Around 100 million as an estimate
21/07/2021, 21:12 - Wezz: ü•∏ and they still use their custom made bulletin board garbage. Round 2?
21/07/2021, 21:14 - Paul: No that's just mental lol
21/07/2021, 21:14 - Paul: You'd have FBI bursting through your ceiling
21/07/2021, 21:15 - Wezz: How is a site this bad worth 100mil. Blows my mind.
21/07/2021, 21:16 - Paul: It just brings in crazy traffic as it's essentially the csgo stats database. They would never risk majorly updating it and scaring everyone off
21/07/2021, 21:16 - Paul: If you compare it to older versions they've done a lot to streamline it while keeping the theme similar to it's classic state

21/07/2021, 21:17 - Paul: Also works pretty nicely on mobile

22/07/2021, 10:41 - James: Especially in Japan, they couldn't be further removed from Germany geographically. I know they were allied in WW2, but there are people in China/India that don't even know what Hitler really did because it didn't really affect them.
22/07/2021, 10:57 - Wezz: The whole Olympics has been mental. That's like the 5th story I've seen on people getting fired for past inappropriate behaviour.
22/07/2021, 10:58 - Wezz: Didn't know cancel culture was that rampant in Asia

22/07/2021, 14:34 - Paul: FBI this comment right here

22/07/2021, 23:00 - Paul: That's why I love the book so much. Just me being cool and awesome
23/07/2021, 08:08 - Wezz: Could never really get into it, too fictional

Not just leave the hall, leave our country ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want you here, in the room or in my country. Listen to me, man! I think we should send them all back.

23/07/2021, 14:54 - Wezz: Also I did triple your damage that game
23/07/2021, 14:55 - Wezz: (or someshit) can't even remember. Just know that I couldn't come down river as I was very much trying to
23/07/2021, 14:57 - Piper: not quite triple
23/07/2021, 14:57 - Wezz: Ah shit you're right, I'm a noob

23/07/2021, 14:59 - Kirky: üòèüòèüòè
23/07/2021, 14:59 - Wezz: Piper's game awareness is that of an unwatered melon
23/07/2021, 14:59 - Paul: But then he gets some kills anyway so everyone else must be wrong
23/07/2021, 15:00 - Derren: You be quiet and download quake
23/07/2021, 15:01 - Wezz: He doesn't even do consistent dmg in league so can't fall back on his Mr Entry Fragger rep. He is our consistent PvE farmer.

23/07/2021, 15:20 - Paul: In conclusion: LoL is dogshit trash game

25/07/2021, 10:24 - Dayle: the scenes
25/07/2021, 11:09 - Noone: anyone else watched Fleabag? just binge wached it all
25/07/2021, 11:36 - Nathan: Disclaimer, what you are about to read maybe concerning to some readers:

We all ONLY know each other because of Paul. He links us all. Distressing read I know. Apologies to lower the mood on a Sunday morning
25/07/2021, 11:36 - Dayle: nah drew was my master
25/07/2021, 11:37 - Paul: Yeah I've made this claim a few times. But Mike debunked it with the introduction of Tapan and Tris
25/07/2021, 11:38 - Noone: Bollocks, I only know you all because of the wrinkled, crumpled up man who lives upstairs
25/07/2021, 11:38 - Nathan: Drew is all our masters! Paul is his recruiting advisor
25/07/2021, 11:39 - Nathan: But we only know Mike because of you, so it's still linked really
25/07/2021, 11:39 - Nathan: Secondary indoctrination
25/07/2021, 11:39 - Paul: I'll take it. I'm the centre of the collective consciousness
25/07/2021, 11:41 - Noone: but you also took a shit in a bidet
25/07/2021, 11:42 - Dayle: oh shit remember when he did that/
25/07/2021, 11:42 - Paul: Jack died multiple times to the first boss in ff7
25/07/2021, 11:50 - Nathan: Even after reading the walk through guide cover to cover as well I heard
25/07/2021, 11:50 - Paul: @447857964894 have any of your air force buddies ever seen a ufo?
25/07/2021, 11:51 - Nathan: Not that they have said. I'm sure they've seen UFOs and then been identified as hercs/chinooks/galaxies etc ü§£
25/07/2021, 11:52 - Paul: I've heard sightings are surprisingly common in the military
25/07/2021, 11:55 - Nathan: Its at what point it goes from a UFO to alien tech I guess though. As I'm sure UFOs are common on forward military bases be it drones/enemy air support etc
25/07/2021, 11:57 - Paul: Yeah. For sure. I guess it's a bit more boring if they are all drones. But way more likely. Although those confirmed unidentified videos from the US Pentagon were pretty interesting

25/07/2021, 18:10 - Qck: they still werent able to obliterate a halfpipe like my techdeck can though
25/07/2021, 18:24 - Lee: The coolest dudes too. Jagger with his pods in and his phone in his pocket. Doesn't give a shit. Women on tomorrow.

25/07/2021, 21:30 - Qck: They all played iso and it's the worst US team ever put out on the court
25/07/2021, 21:30 - Qck: Still shouldn't be losing to Gobert and his sons
25/07/2021, 21:30 - Qck: Fournier shouldn't be dropping 28, but France have some guys who can ball
25/07/2021, 21:31 - Paul: Do they have LeBron?
25/07/2021, 21:31 - Qck: Neg

26/07/2021, 10:46 - Paul: Saw a study linking covid19 with a significant (statistically) decline of intelligence. How are my covid boys doing?
26/07/2021, 10:47 - Paul: Couldn't get much dumber I guess
26/07/2021, 10:47 - James: That's why I've not been going out much, I need to protect my intellect as a precious commodity
26/07/2021, 10:48 - Paul: People who had recovered, including those no longer reporting symptoms, exhibited significant cognitive deficits when controlling for age, gender, education level, income, racial-ethnic group and pre-existing medical disorders.
26/07/2021, 10:49 - Paul: Could be related to this "brain fog" I've heard about a lot
26/07/2021, 11:15 - Dayle: <Media omitted>
26/07/2021, 11:17 - James: Doesn't actually sound terrible, I kinda want to try one
26/07/2021, 11:18 - Dayle: The lemons is the only wildcard
26/07/2021, 11:23 - James: I'm thinkning it's going to be like pineapple on pizza, though I don't like the idea that it still has the rind, as it looks in the picture
26/07/2021, 11:23 - James: 'thinkning'
26/07/2021, 11:24 - Dayle: i'm more curious around what the 'DEEP FLAVORS' means - because its already wild AF
26/07/2021, 11:25 - James: The tartare sauce is a inch thick all over, D E E P  S A U C E
26/07/2021, 11:25 - Mike: Seems like covid has already captured James
26/07/2021, 11:26 - James: Listen mike, the vaccine hasn't unffected my thinkning one slightest one bit actually
26/07/2021, 12:05 - Wezz: Post-viral Fatigue/Gulf War syndrome seems the more traditional explanation
26/07/2021, 12:07 - Wezz: Lots of controlled variables, but did they think:
Stupid man = no vaccine = no preventative actions = more likely to catch COVID = Stupid man
26/07/2021, 12:10 - Wezz: Who decided to keep the rinds on the lemon? Crazy decision and for that reason, I'm out.
26/07/2021, 12:11 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
26/07/2021, 13:13 - Paul: Yes of course. They did a bunch of pretests as well. But the study specifically found a correlate of severity = worse cognitive deficits which basically rules out dumb man gets covid theory. Unless dumb people some how statistically get worse general symptoms
26/07/2021, 15:24 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
26/07/2021, 15:25 - Mike: Ominous
26/07/2021, 15:58 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
26/07/2021, 15:58 - Wezz: Can you have different possessives than pronouns? E.g. she/him/ours‚Ä¶
26/07/2021, 16:00 - Wezz: Good luck working that shit out. Get it wrong and I'll be very upset
26/07/2021, 16:00 - Dayle: alright shim calm down
26/07/2021, 16:19 - Wezz: That's 'we' to you mate
26/07/2021, 16:19 - Wezz: She at the weekends üíÉ
26/07/2021, 16:25 - Paul: Can I pick a random assortment? He/she/us
26/07/2021, 16:25 - Paul: I obviously need more diversity training
26/07/2021, 16:28 - Paul: @447850499652, John Oliver gave an argument that due to the disparity in the housing market because of early legislature that only allowed Caucasian families to invest; there should be reparations distributed to those whose generational wealth had been affected. How mad does that make you?
26/07/2021, 16:30 - Wezz: What a terrible joke, who'd even _think_ like this?
26/07/2021, 16:34 - James: Are we glossing over the fact this guy is basically called Dick Van Dyke?
26/07/2021, 16:38 - Wezz: Look, you can take the piss out of someones pronouns, but not their name.

He didn't _choose_ to be Nic Van Dyck, poor guy.
26/07/2021, 16:38 - Paul: The fuck is Dyck anyway. Is that pronounced Dyke or Dick
26/07/2021, 16:38 - James: I'm not taking the piss, that's a great name
26/07/2021, 16:39 - Wezz: I say dick
26/07/2021, 16:39 - Wezz: He hasn't corrected me
26/07/2021, 16:39 - James: I'm guessing it's actually pronounced dickh
26/07/2021, 16:39 - Wezz: ü•≤
26/07/2021, 16:40 - Noone: John Oliver was a retard before this, it doesn't make me mad
26/07/2021, 16:40 - Paul: Sound mad
26/07/2021, 16:41 - Noone: Does he propose a scaling of reparations? What about how unfairly represented Jews are in media etc
26/07/2021, 16:41 - Noone: Good bait for discussion but ultimately it doesn't go anywhere
26/07/2021, 16:41 - Paul: I'd imagine he would welcome that too
26/07/2021, 16:42 - Paul: He didn't outline exactly what should be done. But he supported the task force thats been proposed to research a way to figure it out
26/07/2021, 16:42 - Paul: Which is where I'm at too
26/07/2021, 16:52 - Wezz: What a virtuous fruitless journey. Who are we trusting in this effort to quantify oppression? Why them?

Any researcher worth their weight will finish a literature review and say "impossible task that will never satisfy those affected and not _solve_ anything", sticky plaster reparation solution, instead invest in education and equal opportunities. There, saved you millions on a 'task force'.
26/07/2021, 16:53 - Wezz: Unless the task force are all BAME? Cause then we're helping
26/07/2021, 16:53 - James: I personally think Sam should be the entire task force
26/07/2021, 16:53 - James: I hope my vote for him puts me in a favourable position to receive my reparations
26/07/2021, 16:55 - Wezz: *whispers* did you get your Mum+Dad to file those divorce papers I sent? I can get you in on that single parenting üí∞, also don't forget those Autism symptoms from primary school
26/07/2021, 16:59 - Paul: Why is it fruitless and impossible to appease? There are thousands of paper trails. People could submit applications with attached evidence... we don't need to trust anyone to quantify oppression of the housing market. It's well documented with literal civil rights dates for when bills were overturned. Not hard to track. I'm not gonna pretend I'd understand the logistics of it. But being against it seems unnecessary. What's the downside exactly?
26/07/2021, 16:59 - Mike: I will perform this task, all I need is a team of grad students and tenure
26/07/2021, 16:59 - James: Don't give it to him, once he has tenure he's set for life!
26/07/2021, 17:04 - Noone: lol
26/07/2021, 17:05 - Paul: Mad
26/07/2021, 17:05 - Noone: too much energy to disagree with you, "lol" is dismissive enough
26/07/2021, 17:05 - Paul: And clarifies to everyone that you have no good argument. Bonus ‚úäüèª
26/07/2021, 17:07 - Noone: living in your own world
26/07/2021, 17:07 - Noone: but I'm sure your complete dismissal of reality will win the war on isms!
26/07/2021, 17:07 - Mike: America won't even give poor people medicare, you think poor BLACK people are getting reparations?
26/07/2021, 17:08 - Noone: reparations for what lol
26/07/2021, 17:08 - Noone: honestly, for what
26/07/2021, 17:09 - Mike: for crack Jack
26/07/2021, 17:09 - Noone: Where are my reparations for the African slave trade/Arabic slave trades?
26/07/2021, 17:09 - Noone: Nobody cares about them because it doesn't give you "gib me" points
26/07/2021, 17:10 - Paul: So you aren't against reparations as long as everyone who gets them deserves them cool
26/07/2021, 17:12 - Noone: Your concept of reparations stem from an obsessive political fetish molded by your own misunderstanding of history and desire to appear caring.
26/07/2021, 17:12 - Noone: You'll convince nobody with your weird desire to appear virtuous, it's transparent and creepy
26/07/2021, 17:13 - Wezz: I guess I have a couple qualms:
1. The practical side: Why is Suzy only entitled to ¬£50 and Ben ¬£100? How about Johnny in a wheelchair who lost his parents? How about Mary, pregnant, with half an arm and no teeth, she's black/Asian, does that change things? If so by how much, _precisely how much_? Do you think Suzy will look at Mary and say "that amount makes sense", of course not. Welcome to the welfare system rev X.
2. My actual feelings on it: It's like a copycat religious repenting process man, old as day, oh "Let's pay reparations to repent our ancestral sin? Doesn't this feel like we're doing so much to address the issue, well done us whites". Makes my skin crawl, and ironically opposing it is met with the label of white guilt/fragility. Those involved are completely oversimplifying the issues into one big 'charitable donation' as opposed to implementing sensible societal changes in supporting those, who at this very moment, need it. Regardless of skin colour.
26/07/2021, 17:15 - Paul: Yes I'm the creepy one üòÖ
26/07/2021, 17:16 - Paul: But reparations on the housing market are directly calcuable wezz
26/07/2021, 17:16 - James: I agree, it very much feels like "With 3 easy payments of just $49.99, you too can absolve your family of the crimes of the past. Make tomorrow an equal opportunity society by throwing money into the void". How do you quantify how much something has actually affected a persons opportunity, and how does that measure against someone else's impacted history?
26/07/2021, 17:17 - Paul: Did you all miss that I'm talking about the housing market and not all reparations?
26/07/2021, 17:17 - Noone: The backbone of the economy? Yeah we know what you're talking about
26/07/2021, 17:18 - Wezz: Reparations: slipperiest most subjective slope, lubed directly with money.

"Yeah, this will sort out the problems in our society"
26/07/2021, 17:18 - Noone: Stop posting communism in the chat Paul, I just want to watch Piper drink himself to death; not think of failed political experiments
26/07/2021, 17:19 - Paul: You and Jack were the ones going on with the whataboutisms yet then you turn around and say slippery slope? It's like the fox news playbook wtf lol
26/07/2021, 17:19 - Wezz: I get you, but it's not the solution. Not when your stratifying variables are RACE lol.
26/07/2021, 17:19 - Paul: Reparations is so far from communism that it hurts to read this
26/07/2021, 17:20 - Paul: When race was the initial blockade then why not
26/07/2021, 17:20 - Wezz: Was race the only blockade?
26/07/2021, 17:20 - Noone: Redistribute the wealth from those deemed the "enemy to the lower classes"
26/07/2021, 17:22 - Noone: group people up into easilly identifiable, meaningless groups and pit them against eachother, with the state favoring one over the other
26/07/2021, 17:22 - Paul: I mean. It was the only blockade yeah. Obviously other factors came in to decide if they could get a mortgage. But all the others are still used now
26/07/2021, 17:22 - Noone: yeah this isn't communism, it's... called being a good guy!
26/07/2021, 17:22 - Paul: Remember when you said you weren't mad
26/07/2021, 17:23 - Qck: Are we talking about NCAA?
26/07/2021, 17:24 - Noone: I'm mad because despite you being the most decorated academic of us with the most hair, you're critically stupid when it comes to your political ideas
26/07/2021, 17:24 - Noone: you shouldn't be this naive but you are, and it's upsetting
26/07/2021, 17:24 - Wezz: I was throwing some very reasonable hypotheticals in which a race stratified system falls short, the idea is so shallowly thought out that it's embarrassing. It's not even Christian levels of self-repent. It's generational repent. Bleurgh.
26/07/2021, 17:24 - Paul: Hah so you are mad rekt
26/07/2021, 17:24 - Noone: <Media omitted>
26/07/2021, 17:26 - Paul: "I was denied a mortgage on this home because the state level residence permit specifically said Caucasian only. Here is my paperwork evidence and the papertrail dating back as well as documents from town hall. "
Thanks for the info we will assess the claim and provide an estimate.
26/07/2021, 17:26 - Paul: This is you all the time right?
26/07/2021, 17:26 - Wezz: What a lovely idea let's do it
26/07/2021, 17:26 - Paul: With the racism that's super funny
26/07/2021, 17:27 - Qck: It's about ratifying a system that was based on race to begin with
26/07/2021, 17:27 - Paul: Yay
26/07/2021, 17:28 - Wezz: I consider you both intelligent individuals, one day we'll sit down over a couple beers and watch the meat fall off this fractured bone of a system you've presented today.
26/07/2021, 17:29 - Noone: shut the fuck up wez
26/07/2021, 17:29 - Paul: +1
26/07/2021, 17:29 - Wezz: I meant Paul and Qck, Jack's a special boy
26/07/2021, 17:30 - Qck: +1
26/07/2021, 17:30 - Paul: I only get in these discussions so people will keep telling me how smart I am and how "academically decorated" I am.
26/07/2021, 17:31 - Paul: Followed by telling me why I'm a retard for not hating blacks and disliking greed
26/07/2021, 17:31 - Paul: And I've got a great hairline too
26/07/2021, 17:32 - James: I think in this situation, reparations is very politically loaded word. I don't think this is reparations as society has come to understand that word. This is no different that if a job has turned away a more qualified person because they are Asian, or a woman. This is just a legal discrimination case, and throwing the word reparation in there just politically charges it. There may be legitimate reasons for that clause, potentially it's a safety thing as a resident has a history of violent crime against minorities (not justifying, just an example off the top of my head).

I don't think what you are saying is unreasonable Paul, but potentially it shows that the current system needs to bulk up to support people reporting and investigating these, rather than a separate task force or entity.
26/07/2021, 17:33 - Paul: Which is why Jack got so mad
26/07/2021, 17:35 - Noone: I follow Black Lives Matter. No matter what they do, I'm a good person because what I say they stand for is good
26/07/2021, 17:36 - Mike: MARXISM
26/07/2021, 17:36 - Noone: what I say I stand for is good therefore I'm good
26/07/2021, 17:36 - Noone: your thinking has been stunted Paulo
26/07/2021, 17:36 - Mike: NOT IN MY BACK YARD
26/07/2021, 17:36 - James: Well, I don't think it in itself makes people mad, but it can certainly lead to frustration on both parties because you end up talking about different issues and breaking down in communication because of the assumptions made on the language and words used.
26/07/2021, 17:36 - James: You're not helping üòÇ
26/07/2021, 17:36 - Paul: We can't all deliberately take the edgiest position mate. That's how you made your whole identity!
26/07/2021, 17:37 - Qck: I just wanna see Jack say this stuff in front of a beautiful black man
26/07/2021, 17:37 - Noone: you're basically black
26/07/2021, 17:37 - Paul: Jack only watches black cuck porn we've established this
26/07/2021, 17:38 - Paul: That's why it makes him so mad. It's post nut clarity
26/07/2021, 17:38 - Qck: Black AND Beautiful
26/07/2021, 17:38 - Mike: no basketball knees though
26/07/2021, 17:38 - Noone: is this irony
26/07/2021, 17:38 - Paul: Heaven forbid people read and use critical thought
26/07/2021, 17:38 - James: What's happened here is the word reparation was used, and at the same time Paul assumed Jack would be racist, and Jack assumed Paul would be a communist, and then the conversation went off a cliff.
26/07/2021, 17:39 - Wezz: James is a great mediator, 10/10
26/07/2021, 17:39 - Noone: Paul assumed Jack would be a racist, and Jack realised Paul was pushing his communism again
26/07/2021, 17:39 - Noone: realistically my world view is basically what we have now, and Paul's will never come to fruition so at the end of the day I win, even if Paul does have more hair than me
26/07/2021, 17:39 - Paul: It's like the priest molesting kids or the evangelicals gay conversion therapist being caught at a gay orgy
26/07/2021, 17:40 - Paul: That's really sad though. Genuinely
26/07/2021, 17:40 - Qck: You're making me hot and horny
26/07/2021, 17:40 - Noone: when i was a kid i was sad because I realised I'd never have a pokemon, but I grew out of that
26/07/2021, 17:40 - Noone: you will too dw
26/07/2021, 17:40 - Mike: @447835575116 no comeback for this Paul? You instead argue with the baby in the mud?
26/07/2021, 17:40 - Paul: No I meant that you're bald
26/07/2021, 17:41 - Noone: got a laugh out of me
26/07/2021, 17:41 - Paul: America sucks this won't happen capitalism destroys everything but it's nice to think we could do better
26/07/2021, 17:42 - Mike: Yeh but its also built everything so far, shame its a game of monopoly where one player becomes the banker over a few generations
26/07/2021, 17:42 - James: I also think that there are two angles here, based on the language used in Paul's example above that Paul is taking a much more USA-centric approach to this, where this is more prevalent, whereas I think Jack, your experience with this is probably mostly limited to people who don't actually have a stake in what is happening and are predominantly virtue signalling, and because of the UK's differences in the racism that is more prevalent, the idea of institutional anti-black rhetoric is much further removed from everyday life.
26/07/2021, 17:42 - Paul: Built everything on the skeletons of the exploited
26/07/2021, 17:43 - Noone: that sure sounds cool
26/07/2021, 17:43 - Qck: If all the NPC dialogue in tonight's DnD is lacking I'm blaming this extra curricular activity
26/07/2021, 17:43 - Paul: He's saying you missed the point coz ur dumb Jack
26/07/2021, 17:44 - Mike: gotta crack a few eggs to make an omlette m8
26/07/2021, 17:44 - Wezz: Nah, everything we have is undeserved and we should feel bad. If you feel good for the things you've done in your life, you should probably feel bad for those your ancestors did in previous lives. We'll use this mentality to forward society as a whole, just stick with it.
26/07/2021, 17:44 - Paul: Spoken like a man eating a raw onion
26/07/2021, 17:44 - James: I'm also saying that you attract more flies with honey than vinegar, and attacking someone is not the way to convince them
26/07/2021, 17:44 - Paul: You can't even convince Jack to not lynch people I'm not even trying
26/07/2021, 17:45 - Mike: Thanks for the onion, Capitalism
26/07/2021, 17:45 - Qck: Paul and Jack are both retards and Wezz is the gigaretard quadriplegic dinosaur that birthed them, all I ever get from these convos
26/07/2021, 17:45 - Qck: Type out your 5 paragraphs with your opinions boys but you're all retarded dinos
26/07/2021, 17:45 - Noone: my ancestor was raped by a member of a neighboring tribe. this happened 14,000 years ago and thanks to interest, I am owed reparations in excess of the monetary value of the asteroid 16 Psyche
26/07/2021, 17:46 - James: Thanks Sam, now to Mike with the weather
26/07/2021, 17:46 - Noone: Which is of course as we all know worth $10,000 quadrillion
26/07/2021, 17:46 - Alex: What a fantastic strawman
26/07/2021, 17:47 - Mike: I think I see Paul flowing away in the German floods atm, clinging desperately to his communist hammer and sickle
26/07/2021, 17:47 - Wezz: But Daddy James, Paul used the ad hominem first when he wasn't hailed as the black savior he thought he would be for his selfless solution that has no negative repercussions.
26/07/2021, 17:48 - James: Yes Master Wesley, but what have I said about encouraging them? Now run along and tidy the toy room and I won't tell your mother
26/07/2021, 17:48 - Paul: Right I'm walking Freddie but when I get back piper better have weighed in on this mess.
26/07/2021, 17:48 - Wezz: He said Jack had less hair, but his hair is ginger. So who's hair is worth more? Let's let the RaceSquad‚Ñ¢Ô∏è decide!
26/07/2021, 17:48 - Noone: it's not a strawman, it's true. At some point my ancestor was raped by someone. I am owed reparations
26/07/2021, 17:48 - Noone: now explain why I am not entiteled reparations but X group is. I'll wait for you to type our your seething thoughts
26/07/2021, 17:49 - Alex: No thanks
26/07/2021, 17:49 - Noone: at some point my ancestors hut was attacked by another group, some of my family have been subjugated and killed, and my grandparents grandparents worked in a mine and were mistreated by the British. When do I get my sad-sad points
26/07/2021, 17:50 - Qck: Was it you? Are you that ancestor?
26/07/2021, 17:50 - Paul: This isn't the gotcha you think it is. As it just confirms that reparations are worthwhile
26/07/2021, 17:50 - Qck: Also none of my ancestors were raped, proud rapers in the Williams clan
26/07/2021, 17:50 - Noone: it proves the reparations cannot be fairly distributed, and any arbritrary limit will just lead to another generation of people who were "mistreated" by the system
26/07/2021, 17:50 - Noone: lol
26/07/2021, 17:51 - Paul: This means he's dismissing you
26/07/2021, 17:51 - Paul: So you agree that they are good in theory? But it's difficult to execute?
26/07/2021, 17:51 - Qck: Our clan crest reads: Non Possum Opprimere Me
26/07/2021, 17:51 - Noone: explain why my example doesn't completely and utterly invalidate TV man oliver's idea
26/07/2021, 17:52 - Noone: Good in theory? No, they're stupid in theory
Difficult to execute? Not at all. You can virtuously pick any group and give them a billion dollars if you want, it doesn't make it less stupid
26/07/2021, 17:52 - Paul: "If he gets something for the bad thing that happened to him I also want something for the bad thing that happened to me" ok great. I agree.
26/07/2021, 17:52 - Noone: at which point we end up making sure everyone has everything the exact same
26/07/2021, 17:52 - Noone: wait a second, this isn't meant to be communism- uhh
26/07/2021, 17:52 - Paul: Mwhahaha
26/07/2021, 17:53 - Wezz: _Round and round but where does it stop? What's the sign on the lollipop?_
26/07/2021, 17:53 - Wezz: I want at least ¬£50 reparations for this conversation
26/07/2021, 17:53 - Paul: We are talking concept not execution.
26/07/2021, 17:54 - Paul: It's about the theory of WHY it's done. Not saying that everything is deserving of it
26/07/2021, 17:54 - Wezz: As always with your utopian virtuous bs
26/07/2021, 17:54 - Noone: oh ok fair enough. In concept I hope nobody gets cancer and there was no such thing as war, or headaches, or bruises on bananas
26/07/2021, 17:54 - Paul: Doubt
26/07/2021, 17:54 - Dayle: <Media omitted>
26/07/2021, 17:54 - Paul: But also too stubborn to admit that you agree with the virtuous side of it because it is difficult to do lol
26/07/2021, 17:55 - Noone: the real question I want answered is: "How much of Pauls money will he have to donate before his white guilt is sated"
26/07/2021, 17:55 - Paul: Just enough to counter your donations to KKK
26/07/2021, 17:55 - Noone: "My idea is practically impossible to achieve, but you're dumb because you don't think it's a good idea"
26/07/2021, 17:56 - Paul: Not what I said is it
26/07/2021, 17:56 - James: I think ultimately what this boils down to is extending and maintaining something along the lines of the UK benefit system before it was shot by the last few governments. If you fits into certain categories, we acknowledge that your opportunities are limited or affected in some way and you are given extra to assist with that situation.
26/07/2021, 17:56 - Paul: That would be great
26/07/2021, 17:56 - Noone: I'm not going to validate your vacuous ideals because it'll just spur you on to keep coming up with new ways to cuck yourself politically
26/07/2021, 17:57 - Paul: Ok mate keep on chirping that line
26/07/2021, 17:57 - Noone: Don't have ajob
Are disabled
Have squeezed out too many bastard children
26/07/2021, 17:57 - Dayle: i open my watsapp and your all a bunch of white cucks
26/07/2021, 17:57 - James: But do you disagree with the benefits system as a principal?
26/07/2021, 17:58 - Noone: nope
26/07/2021, 17:58 - Paul: You're
26/07/2021, 17:58 - Dayle: my point
26/07/2021, 17:58 - Dayle: anyway - im stepping out again, have at it ol chaps
26/07/2021, 17:58 - Wezz: Yup, and this is happening now through various charities. I totally support it's careful inclusion in government policies. Well  that was boring.
26/07/2021, 17:59 - Noone: "I want to implement a radical change of taking things from people and giving them to a select group who I deem worthy based on flaky historical justification. What, don't you like it? Don't you like this existing system which benefits everyone without prejudice? It's the exact same thing!"
26/07/2021, 18:00 - Paul: Jack remember when you said I don't live in reality
26/07/2021, 18:00 - Paul: Good times
26/07/2021, 18:00 - Noone: re-read the chat Paul
26/07/2021, 18:00 - James: But what this conversation started with is someone saying "should we have a look at whether we also need to include this other criteria?"
26/07/2021, 18:00 - Noone: you're right we should give blacks more money
26/07/2021, 18:00 - Noone: Paul wins
26/07/2021, 18:01 - Paul: I won by default the second you opened your mouth (typed with thumbs)
26/07/2021, 18:01 - Noone: "Sir we've done what you said, and racism is still a thing? The ¬£2000 stimulous check we wrote to minotirites hasn't worked; what now???"
26/07/2021, 18:02 - James: That's not what I'm saying, and your dismissiveness isn't constructive. If this conversation was about a disability that wasn't included or understood it would be totally different. Nobody is saying to do anything blindly, but at least looking into whether it should be considered isn't going to kill the economy.
26/07/2021, 18:02 - Noone: I don't think you've come out on top of a political discussion since you learned how to spell
26/07/2021, 18:04 - Dayle: So that new league champ aye? huehuehue
26/07/2021, 18:06 - Noone: shut up Dayle I'm trying to be spiteful
26/07/2021, 18:08 - Dayle: <Media omitted>
26/07/2021, 18:08 - Wezz: I opened a crack shop and it worked out _pretty well for me_.
26/07/2021, 18:09 - Wezz: All the cool kids say "crack shop" right... right?
26/07/2021, 18:10 - Noone: I'm confused
26/07/2021, 18:11 - Dayle: the correct term would be trap house
26/07/2021, 18:11 - Wezz: Thanks Dayle, did you wanna join this new RaceForce‚Ñ¢Ô∏è Paul's starting? We could really use a hip guy like you
26/07/2021, 18:13 - Dayle: Nah i have better things to do.. like wank on a wall and watch it dry.
26/07/2021, 18:13 - Wezz: We need to understand why the poor are just so smelly and poor all the time
26/07/2021, 18:13 - Wezz: You've done enough kind sir
26/07/2021, 18:13 - Noone: imagining you sat on a wall having a wank, but what are you watching dry?
26/07/2021, 18:14 - Dayle: this chat into a shrivelled prune of white men sauce arguing around silly things
26/07/2021, 18:15 - Dayle: anyway im out peace lads thought i would come in and cause some chaos and get off topic because you all started throwing gloves at each other
26/07/2021, 18:16 - Wezz: How very dare you, we were one whatsapp message away from solving racial injustice!!!
26/07/2021, 18:17 - Wezz: And QCK was about to pay reparations by taking a knee... not in that way.
26/07/2021, 18:17 - Noone: you're incabable of starting a fire, let along chaos amid my genius mind
26/07/2021, 18:18 - Noone: my genius mind didn't mistype "alone" as "along"
26/07/2021, 18:29 - Paul: Haha THIS
26/07/2021, 18:45 - Kirky: <Media omitted>
26/07/2021, 18:47 - Mike: James came out on top of this convo imo, all hail DM James
26/07/2021, 18:48 - Mike: I dub Jack "Itty bitty what about communist titty" boy
26/07/2021, 18:48 - James: Thanks Mike, the dice shall roll favourably for you tonight
26/07/2021, 18:48 - Mike: And Paul shall now be "Won't someone please think of the negroids" child
26/07/2021, 18:50 - Mike: As is our new tradition James, you can now expel one member of this chat for at most a year. So it shall be.
26/07/2021, 18:51 - James: I expel Barack Obama from this chat. I have known he was lurking for far too long, and I'm glad I can finally do something about it. I HAVE SPOKEN!
26/07/2021, 18:53 - Qck: well my fellow americans, it seems the goose is loose and i must leave this chat
26/07/2021, 18:53 - Wezz: I KNEW IT
26/07/2021, 18:53 - Mike: *Barrack Hussein Obama left*
26/07/2021, 18:54 - Qck: ooh two hard r's there mike, have you been drinking from jack's kool-aid?
26/07/2021, 18:54 - Mike: *Mike The Bald left*
26/07/2021, 21:52 - Dayle: New world dungeons are incredible
26/07/2021, 21:54 - Qck: Do they have a half man half giraffe as a riddle keeper?
26/07/2021, 21:55 - Mike: yes
26/07/2021, 21:56 - Qck: Then I guess Dayle is buying me an account

26/07/2021, 22:29 - Kirky: "Clunky and unresponsive"
26/07/2021, 22:29 - Paul: This guy is trying way too hard to be like Yahtzee from zero punctuation
26/07/2021, 22:30 - Kirky: Ngl thats basically all I need to hear sorry dayle
26/07/2021, 22:31 - Dayle: Its really not tbh, but okay
26/07/2021, 22:34 - Derren: Didn't even watch the vid
26/07/2021, 22:34 - Derren: üòÇ
26/07/2021, 22:36 - Dayle: Does the guy just run around the starting area?
26/07/2021, 22:36 - Dayle: If so top review 10/10 fucking pepege, imagine reviewing lol on the tutorial
26/07/2021, 22:45 - Dayle: https://youtu.be/LQtkzvvCUvk
26/07/2021, 22:46 - Kirky: No he does pvp too
26/07/2021, 22:47 - Dayle: He slays the combat as well but I assume they don't like the new style
26/07/2021, 22:48 - Dayle: Bollocks games great i stand by it lol
26/07/2021, 22:50 - Paul: Review was ok. He was reasonably fair. But his main criticisms weren't really relevant. Server issues and lag that will obviously get resolved. And he kept saying that because Amazon is a trillion dollar company is should be better but never explained how.
26/07/2021, 22:51 - Paul: But just from watching the review I know my pc would explode trying to play it
26/07/2021, 22:52 - Lockers: Just get a new pc maaaan
26/07/2021, 22:52 - Paul: I want to. But gpus are a billion euros
26/07/2021, 22:53 - Lockers: I think you're exaggerating
26/07/2021, 23:06 - Wezz: so true, the inflections and cuts. Just missing the stickmen
26/07/2021, 23:07 - Wezz: Tutorial is the best part of the game tbh
26/07/2021, 23:21 - Qck: imagine allowing cunts like this to slip into your subconscious

tbh i had him as having hands until paul started talking about his hooves
27/07/2021, 00:13 - Qck: feel like if you're a biped (minotaur) then you have hands, if you're a quadruped (centaurs, jack noone) then you have hooves
27/07/2021, 00:39 - James: There's one solution here that nobody is considering: https://media.tenor.com/images/7dfd2c95543442ba441a3585c184da8f/tenor.gif

27/07/2021, 08:09 - Paul: Was talking about this yesterday before the racism war
27/07/2021, 08:13 - Derren: Was like a thousand messages so I didn't read
27/07/2021, 08:25 - Paul: Didn't miss anything new
27/07/2021, 10:59 - Wezz: @447588936693 you missed this meme. I'm still trying to figure it out.

_but who was ball?_
27/07/2021, 11:06 - Paul: üß≤
27/07/2021, 11:28 - Derren: Maybe we don't get it cos we got covid and now our iq is lower
27/07/2021, 11:31 - Wezz: Is playing Aion for over 10 years linked to a 'substantial' drop in intelligence?
27/07/2021, 11:32 - Derren: Probably
27/07/2021, 11:39 - Wezz: I spent a solid hour last night learning about rollback netcode, super simple but smart stuff.
27/07/2021, 11:39 - Wezz: Makes a tonne of sense for fighting games, crazy flagship companies aren't doing iot
27/07/2021, 11:40 - Dayle: link?
27/07/2021, 11:40 - Wezz: i watched a few vids, there was a really good one, one sec will find

27/07/2021, 17:07 - Paul: So what's today's debate? Euthanasia?
27/07/2021, 17:07 - Kirky: we voting on euthanising jack?
27/07/2021, 17:07 - Paul: I think it's not a matter of if but when
27/07/2021, 17:10 - James: I think it's not a matter of when but how
27/07/2021, 17:15 - Wezz: And how?
27/07/2021, 17:15 - Paul: Jokes on you

27/07/2021, 20:14 - Derren: The person in the house across from me just took a picture of me with the flash on
27/07/2021, 20:14 - Derren: And then ran away, I'm not sure what to do
27/07/2021, 20:15 - Derren: It's 2 5 floor houses combined so I have no idea the number of the flat shes in
27/07/2021, 20:16 - James: Were you exposing yourself to the window?
27/07/2021, 20:18 - Mike: Again*
27/07/2021, 20:37 - Nathan: "My friend will not believe the size of this guys nose, must get a pic for proof"
27/07/2021, 20:48 - Derren: Was putting dirty clothes in a washing machine
27/07/2021, 20:59 - Paul: This can't possibly be nice guy Nathan

27/07/2021, 21:12 - Derren: üëÄ
27/07/2021, 21:18 - Qck: "whipped it out" guy is packing at least
27/07/2021, 21:19 - Qck: perfectly executed
27/07/2021, 21:27 - Paul: I never really considered that phrasing to have a large penis prerequisite
27/07/2021, 21:28 - Qck: try and whip yours out and see what success you have
27/07/2021, 21:29 - James: Whips need to have some length to crack at the end right?
27/07/2021, 21:29 - Qck: whipping implies you're getting at least 50% of your cock out of the band of your trousers to be able to effectively whip
27/07/2021, 21:29 - Paul: Depends who is cracking it? Tiny little stick man could whip a short piece of string
27/07/2021, 21:29 - James: I think at a certain length it stops whipping and starts flicking
27/07/2021, 21:29 - Qck: we're talking about cocks here
27/07/2021, 21:30 - James: Show me someone that can crack a short piece of string
27/07/2021, 21:30 - Paul: James said whips
27/07/2021, 21:30 - Qck: we all know he meant cocks
27/07/2021, 21:30 - Paul: Theoretical tiny stick man could
27/07/2021, 21:30 - James: Yeah but theoretical tiny stick man has a massive cock
27/07/2021, 21:30 - Dayle: Just one leg one cock
27/07/2021, 21:32 - Paul: Your concept of cock whipping stem from an obsessive political fetish molded by your own misunderstanding of history and desire to appear caring.
27/07/2021, 21:33 - James: Well, I am often called cracker because my massive penis cracks as I walk
27/07/2021, 21:33 - Mike: New guidance from the EU is that Cockerel whipping is detrimental to the birds health

27/07/2021, 23:20 - Wezz: A 50 pound mound? Don't be ridiculous.
28/07/2021, 08:07 - Paul: Mental that people in London are so nature starved that they can charge people money to climb a fake hill
28/07/2021, 08:08 - James: Papa, what is a tuh-ree?
28/07/2021, 08:41 - Paul: @447757709019 Joey Jordison died
28/07/2021, 08:42 - Dayle: Elon musks gf is a fucking weirdo, change my mind
28/07/2021, 08:42 - Kirky: Yes I heard at work üò≠
28/07/2021, 08:43 - Paul: Crazy I didn't even know he was ill

28/07/2021, 09:23 - Derren: People are saying that hill in marble arch reminds them of bob-omb battlefield
28/07/2021, 09:23 - Dayle: Yeah like you're mum ass
28/07/2021, 09:23 - Dayle: Wheeey

28/07/2021, 09:27 - Paul: Yes?
28/07/2021, 09:28 - Paul: I also live in a city
28/07/2021, 09:28 - Lee: Third greenest in the world of its size according to a report by The City of London Corporation.
28/07/2021, 09:28 - Derren: Or the 1st/2nd biggest economical cities within 15miles from your house

28/07/2021, 09:42 - Mike: not many of us so probably not a big deal
28/07/2021, 09:45 - Paul: I can see the new social network movie. Us all sitting on one side of the table with screenshots of Mike telling us to bump up his scores and demanding compensation from Mike (a now multimillionaire). He shouts across the table "if you guys were smart enough to come up with Stardew Valley Toolbox.... then you would have come up with Stardew Valley Toolbox". While Sorkin masturbates in the corner.

28/07/2021, 09:57 - Derren: That scroll shit only happens on the bundle tracker screen
28/07/2021, 09:58 - Mike: Its not a game, its a collection of tools for Stardew Valley (a farming simulator)
28/07/2021, 09:58 - Mike: Na I find apps with sound annoying
28/07/2021, 09:58 - Derren: Nice 2fps animations
28/07/2021, 09:58 - Mike: Jack named it then abandoned the project
28/07/2021, 09:58 - Derren: <Media omitted>
28/07/2021, 09:59 - Paul: I like the satisfying noise when I click something. Can always have a disable option. Customer is always right in matters of taste

28/07/2021, 10:11 - James: Yeah, my teams are Blue and Red, and sometimes White as well when we need a third, your teams have too much time on there hands, give them more coding to do
28/07/2021, 10:11 - Mike: When was the last time you saw Gorilla's hunting prey?

28/07/2021, 10:13 - James: I'm working from home, and as the newspaper Kirky sent yesterday said, my dick is bascially constantly out
28/07/2021, 10:13 - Mike: When I joined Nando's they had teams like, Team Mango & Lime, Team Chillis, Team Lemon. My first question was, ok, what do each of these teams do? Shit wank names
28/07/2021, 10:14 - Mike: I've been cautioned by my doctor not to whip it anymore
28/07/2021, 10:14 - James: Work on different levels of spicy projects, something looks really tricky and could destroy someone's bank account? Send that to the EXTRA HOT team
28/07/2021, 10:14 - Qck: i was gonna say are you given a free pass to be sexually inappropriate with the extra hot team
28/07/2021, 10:15 - James: When I worked on a different product, my teams were called Puma, Tiger, Hawk and Phoenix. One of those things was not like the others.
28/07/2021, 10:15 - Dayle: does the ethnicity vary on spice? like plain all the Caucasians so on so fourth - i thought nandos was progressive.
28/07/2021, 10:15 - Mike: The Mango & Lime team are where all the hotties are, literally the only 3 female developers in Nandos are in that team (and are actually pretty hot)
28/07/2021, 10:15 - Paul: Go team white
28/07/2021, 10:15 - James: Quick, screenshot and sent to HR

"Phoenix"

"No Steve a real animal, also why do you want to rise from ashes? Are you going to fail your first project?"

"TEAM PHOENIX KAKAW KAKAW"
28/07/2021, 10:17 - James: White team are unironically the team we pull together of the best devs when we need something quick. I have to stifle inappropriate laughter when people say things like 'They would be able to do this as fast as the White team'
28/07/2021, 10:17 - Paul: This is fantastic
28/07/2021, 10:17 - Qck: vs some plankton 10,000 feet deep in the ocean? i think not!

28/07/2021, 10:18 - Paul: To be fair gorillas might be amazing scoobadivers for all we know
28/07/2021, 10:18 - Derren: And they're insanely strong
28/07/2021, 10:18 - James: Depends how much vodka is in it
28/07/2021, 10:18 - Qck: chat isnt getting better than this, might as well kill myself now
28/07/2021, 10:18 - Mike: The cow or the drink?
28/07/2021, 10:18 - Mike: üòÇ
28/07/2021, 10:18 - Paul: Did I really just type scooba instead of scuba
28/07/2021, 10:19 - Dayle: ü§£ü§£
28/07/2021, 10:19 - James: Would you do it for a scooba snack?
28/07/2021, 10:19 - James: It's also SCUBA not scuba
28/07/2021, 10:19 - Qck: smoking skooma over there

28/07/2021, 10:22 - Paul: Tits
28/07/2021, 10:22 - James: I thought we established the other day that you only virtue signal, so you'd never talk shit about a leftie
28/07/2021, 10:22 - Paul: True I only say things for clout and to appear good. Booo
28/07/2021, 10:23 - Mike: tapan vs a cow, both naked and unarmed in a sand coliseum

28/07/2021, 10:23 - Qck: can't believe the cow is naked too, seems unfair
28/07/2021, 10:23 - Paul: What's the goal? Death or submission?
28/07/2021, 10:24 - Mike: We all know Tapan would never submit
28/07/2021, 10:24 - Qck: blackout before i tapout
28/07/2021, 10:24 - James: I reckon Tapan could piledrive a cow
28/07/2021, 10:24 - Paul: It it's submission I'm going with Tapan. He can just claim the cow has submitted and we can't really confirm he's wrong
28/07/2021, 10:25 - Qck: black up before i tap up
black man before i tapan
28/07/2021, 10:25 - Qck: i'm wasted on you guys

28/07/2021, 10:31 - Paul: <Media omitted>
28/07/2021, 10:31 - James: He looks like a sad lion, what have you done to him
28/07/2021, 10:31 - Paul: Told him he doesn't get a bone today
28/07/2021, 10:32 - James: Bully
28/07/2021, 11:03 - Wezz: Imagine owning a ROG 2 gaming phone and not being able to swipe little 8bit symbols at more than 3fps
28/07/2021, 11:04 - Wezz: Wouldn't take bongs of this man
28/07/2021, 11:09 - Wezz: "Susan, we can't stick Chandran in the lemon and herb team... we'll lose our jobs!"
28/07/2021, 11:13 - Piper: bread from swimming dogs

28/07/2021, 11:17 - Wezz: I wholeheartedly stand by my *yes*.

When I'm standing there, screwdriver in hand, bloody and victorious, with a stupid dead cow on the floor. A wave of sadness will wash over everyone present but my point will be proven ü™õ
28/07/2021, 11:21 - Wezz: Chuckled at a lot, but this had me giggling. Fucking rhino matador man, she's ready
28/07/2021, 11:22 - Wezz: Ready and unperturbed
28/07/2021, 12:01 - Mike: But can't move down on a screen, join Paul's ancient flip phone in shame
28/07/2021, 12:02 - Paul: I can get on-board with pipers campaign and slogan
28/07/2021, 12:11 - Mike: Oh yeh? And who would pay for all this?
28/07/2021, 12:12 - James: Piper is self funding from betting 300k on snail racing
28/07/2021, 12:12 - Paul: It'll just trickle down don't worry about it
28/07/2021, 12:12 - Paul: Bear down for bread from swimming dogs
28/07/2021, 12:14 - Wezz: I've been waiting for this opportunity all my life, where do I sign?
28/07/2021, 12:14 - Paul: I'm just a dreamer. Piper is the logistics man
28/07/2021, 12:23 - Paul: üêª bear down

28/07/2021, 12:23 - James: Dude you can't say that, that's so insensitive!
28/07/2021, 12:24 - Paul: But that's why it's great! It's topical and gets you thinking! We've got a real cause here
28/07/2021, 12:25 - Wezz: Yeah you can't use the yellow swimmer during the Tokyo Olympics...
28/07/2021, 12:25 - Wezz: Piper did you employ this "dreamer"?
28/07/2021, 12:25 - James: Someone needs to take responibility
28/07/2021, 12:25 - Derren: Snapdragon 855+ 8gb ram, dual stereo front facing speakers, 120hz refresh rate screen 240hz touch sampling rate, 2 trigger buttons, 6000 mah battery that lasts 2 days, 30w charging is more than enough for my needs
28/07/2021, 12:25 - Wezz: I'll take this, if someone takes the responsibility
28/07/2021, 12:25 - Paul: Stfu

28/07/2021, 12:28 - Paul: Yeah man that super hi-tech phone is totally worth it for a guy who has grown a symbiosis with his computer chair
28/07/2021, 12:30 - James: FUCK

28/07/2021, 14:35 - Paul: I thought you were of the opinion that we should trust judges and their institutional duty to make decisions?
28/07/2021, 14:35 - Paul: Or is that only when it suits you
28/07/2021, 14:37 - Paul: Yeah did you have a stroke Piper?
28/07/2021, 14:40 - Paul: I actually think Hitler was a pretty decent painter tbh

28/07/2021, 14:44 - Noone: Not saying it doesn't exist, it's just prescribed to people who didn't focus on reading most of the time
28/07/2021, 14:45 - Paul: Do you have slight idea how dyslexia is diagnosed?
28/07/2021, 14:45 - Noone: Easier to tell a parent is retarded than their child won't sit the fuck still and read a fucking book
28/07/2021, 14:46 - Noone: You need to believe this because your field is based in this loosey goosey world of bullshit science so I don't doubt you'll seethe
28/07/2021, 14:46 - Paul: True
28/07/2021, 14:47 - Mike: Jack is roleplaying a member of my family chat
28/07/2021, 14:47 - Paul: Like who can fucking tell when you're being satirical anymore, its not out of the realms of possibility that you're serious
28/07/2021, 14:47 - Noone: Easier to tell a parent "your child...
28/07/2021, 14:48 - Noone: Someone disagrees with me therefore this a piece of satirical comedy

28/07/2021, 14:50 - Paul: I can't parse this level of trolling, someone intervene before I have an aneurysm
28/07/2021, 14:51 - James: Can you be sure aneurysms exist? I've never had one
28/07/2021, 14:51 - Paul: *head explodes*
28/07/2021, 14:51 - James: Personally I think aneurysms are overdiagnosed to lazy people that don't want to think anymore
28/07/2021, 14:51 - Paul: No that's just your festishism based on your misunderstanding of history
28/07/2021, 14:52 - Noone: ADHD is also a disease too widely diagnosed

28/07/2021, 14:54 - Noone: LISTEN TO MY OPINIONS GIVE ME ATTENTION
28/07/2021, 14:54 - James: Oof, he thinks he's your friend Mike
28/07/2021, 14:55 - James: Are you actually angry at the doctors because they didn't give YOU a diagnosis?
28/07/2021, 14:55 - James: Is this all projecting?
28/07/2021, 14:56 - Paul: Jack would baffle a psychologist with his overwhelming IQ and wit. Like Hannibal Lecter

29/07/2021, 12:02 - Derren: I thought conservatives were good for people making money
29/07/2021, 12:03 - Paul: Making money for the rich*

29/07/2021, 12:03 - Mike: Well some are for and some are against, whos to say who is right?
29/07/2021, 12:03 - Mike: Maybe its a spectrum, y'know?
29/07/2021, 12:03 - Paul: This annoys me more than Jack

29/07/2021, 13:27 - Noone: A group of 42 Holocaust academics has said the centre could portray Britain as "the ultimate saviour of the Jews".

In a joint letter to the public inquiry, they said: "Situating the UK Holocaust memorial next to the Houses of Parliament is likely to create a celebratory narrative of the British government's responses to the Jewish catastrophe during the Nazi era and beyond."

But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer backed the project, arguing it was "vital" in educating future generations about the Holocaust.
29/07/2021, 13:42 - Mike: Lol Starmer would back anything now after the flack labour got
29/07/2021, 13:46 - Paul: Which side are you on so I know which side to not be on

29/07/2021, 14:49 - James: To gold you say?
29/07/2021, 14:54 - Noone: I'm torn because I don't want the memorial but at the same time disagree with the holocaust academics who seem to not think we were the ultimate saviours of the Jews, despite being in the war the longest and spearheading the operations the ultimately liberated concentration camps. Maybe just build a park or better yet, more housing for people
29/07/2021, 15:02 - Kirky: Build houses for displaced Palestinians üëç
29/07/2021, 15:02 - Paul: Saying we were the ultimate saviour of the Jews seems like a bit of an irrelevant and reductionist sentiment. Also a very immodest stance to take considering we were far more concerned with protecting our own economic interests than saving them.
29/07/2021, 15:05 - James: I think nobody is saying nothing was done during the war, but I think the concern they expressed is that they didn't want it to be a pat on the back for the government, rather than a memorial, which inherently should be about the people lost. I do think it is important to have areas like this as regular reminders in every day life to prevent these patterns of hate emerging again.
29/07/2021, 15:06 - Paul: Dachau is a great example of this done well
29/07/2021, 15:41 - Kirky: Guy got assaulted at work today üëç
29/07/2021, 15:41 - Kirky: LOOKED AT ME FUNNY, PRICK

29/07/2021, 15:42 - James: That's a rough first week
29/07/2021, 15:42 - Kirky: Yea lmao
29/07/2021, 15:42 - Kirky: Never heard of it before, especially around here
29/07/2021, 15:42 - Paul: Fake police?
29/07/2021, 15:43 - Kirky: Community support
29/07/2021, 15:43 - Kirky: Says police but cant actually do anything
29/07/2021, 15:43 - Paul: Lol
29/07/2021, 15:44 - Dayle: "My van now bitch"
29/07/2021, 15:44 - Kirky: 100% expect to go in tomorrow and it's been nicked
29/07/2021, 15:51 - James: Some rando is sat in your office "Always wanted to be a postie"

29/07/2021, 16:37 - Mike: Poor bastard lol
29/07/2021, 16:37 - Derren: Sounds like a setup
29/07/2021, 16:37 - Derren: Also surely your vans are gps tracked
29/07/2021, 16:37 - Paul: Yeah kirky where exactly where you?
29/07/2021, 16:38 - James: Yeah, but they only tracked it to the nearest delivery centre then it got lost, sorry.
29/07/2021, 16:38 - Derren: Also what I don't understand is why they want to build memorials for shit that happened nearly 100 years ago but there's tons of shit happening right now that they could help with/stop but instead they do  üôà
29/07/2021, 16:39 - Derren: If you want examples of the above please speak to our resident SJW Jack Noone
29/07/2021, 16:39 - James: Yeah, but part of preventing the stuff now is understanding how the same stuff has happened in the past, and what would happen if thing aren't changed
29/07/2021, 16:40 - James: Government can't exactly make a new law that says "Being racist is double illegal now, because regular illegal wasn't enough of a deterrent"
29/07/2021, 16:40 - Derren: I meant moreso global shit that's happening
29/07/2021, 16:40 - Derren: Not this BLM crap
29/07/2021, 16:41 - Paul: Not much recently compares to WW2 I guess
29/07/2021, 16:45 - Paul: Why do you assume it would be the same people for both these options and that they chose this instead? Be mad at other frivolous spending not this. It's like blaming NASA budget for schools needing equipment
29/07/2021, 16:47 - Derren: NASA is making scientific breakthroughs
29/07/2021, 16:47 - Paul: Wasn't even close to the point
29/07/2021, 17:00 - James: But the other thing is that it's also an educational center, it's not just a momento to the past, this is attempting to fix the issues at hand
29/07/2021, 17:09 - Derren: Jews have enough money they can make their own statues and memorials
29/07/2021, 17:09 - Derren: Instead of being the Head of banks, Hollywood, Israel, stealing bombing raping fuck them
29/07/2021, 17:09 - Paul: True we should form some sort of group to stop them
29/07/2021, 17:20 - James: We can call it the "Justice Each Week Before Anti Semitism Has Exited Reality"
29/07/2021, 17:20 - Wezz: üòÇ
29/07/2021, 17:20 - James: Or the JEWBASHERs
29/07/2021, 17:22 - Paul: Or the Jews Are Cuck Kids Now Obviously One Needs Eggs
29/07/2021, 17:23 - Wezz: How bad must your life be to spit on a postman... like, I even get upset with a care provider cause you're in a vulnerable state. But start your day spitting on a postman? Maybe it's an old wives tale; spit on a postman a day keeps the police away.
29/07/2021, 17:24 - Wezz: Gangsters start getting superstitious
29/07/2021, 17:24 - James: Spit on the postman a day keeps the postman away
29/07/2021, 17:25 - Paul: It's like you haven't seen how mad video games make people
29/07/2021, 17:26 - Wezz: Steal his van, become the post man.
29/07/2021, 17:26 - James: Do you know where the apple doctor thing came from originally?
29/07/2021, 17:26 - Paul: Some giant soul sucking apple company no doubt
29/07/2021, 17:27 - Wezz: If I was Paul; I'd assume from Granny Smith herself.
29/07/2021, 17:27 - Paul: Was it Steve jobs
29/07/2021, 17:27 - Wezz: Well; her marketing firm
29/07/2021, 17:27 - Wezz: ding ding ding
29/07/2021, 17:29 - James: Well, the first doctor, Mr. Doctor (he was Mr as doctors hadn't been invented yet) was spending his days seeing to his many patients, as he quite a backlog from all of history. He found out one day that his wife was sleeping with an apple salesman, and vowed to never treat anyone who supported his business again. If he saw you with an apple, regardless of where you bought it, he would strike from his list. So the saying sprung up that an apple a day guaranteed that the doctor wouldn't come anywhere near you.
29/07/2021, 17:30 - James: Fun little fact for you all there
29/07/2021, 17:31 - Paul: What was his first name?
29/07/2021, 17:31 - James: Lost to history
29/07/2021, 17:31 - Paul: So it wasnt Mr?
29/07/2021, 17:31 - James: Are you an idiot? Mr was his title
29/07/2021, 17:31 - Paul: I thought maybe it was before titles
29/07/2021, 17:32 - James: Titles have been around since dinosaurs
29/07/2021, 17:32 - Wezz: Thanks James - most I've ever learnt from these degenerates.
29/07/2021, 17:32 - Paul: I thought they were invented by John Mister
29/07/2021, 17:33 - James: That's an urban myth, he just refined them
29/07/2021, 17:33 - James: I try my best, thanks Sam
29/07/2021, 17:34 - Paul: Sorry I meant John Mister the velociraptor
29/07/2021, 17:34 - James: Oh, yeah, the velociraptor's name was spelt J√©an Mister, that's what confused me

30/07/2021, 13:21 - Nathan: My life's work is finally coming to fruition. DOWN WITH JACK'S
30/07/2021, 14:02 - Noone: At what point is it no longer a pandemic?
30/07/2021, 14:05 - James: Pandemic ends as soon as players have found cures for all four diseases. (You do not need to eradicate any diseases to win.) Because it‚Äôs a co-op game, everyone wins!
30/07/2021, 14:05 - James: Source: https://www.dicebreaker.com/games/pandemic/how-to/how-to-play-pandemic-board-game#end-of-the-game

30/07/2021, 14:09 - James: Jokes on you, you were the last disease! WE WIN EVERYONE!
30/07/2021, 14:11 - Noone: As I shrivel away in my Petri dish I get one last glimpse of you all smiling and celebrating. My last feeling is one of crushing, bitter envy.
30/07/2021, 14:20 - James: "What is this feeling? Relief? Yes, that's it. I've been beaten, but maybe I wanted the humans to win, to grow. Huh, it's funny how things seem to become clearer at the end. Well done humanity, I'm...  proud of you"
30/07/2021, 14:23 - Paul: I dream this about you often

30/07/2021, 16:19 - Piper: leave the snail alone
30/07/2021, 16:19 - Piper: snails live matter

31/07/2021, 09:21 - Wezz: I thought you did a lovely job Jack. Mike's just jealous of your new car friend
31/07/2021, 09:27 - Mike: Blizzard Recruiters Asked Hacker If She ‚ÄòLiked Being Penetrated‚Äô at Job Fair
31/07/2021, 09:28 - Mike: "One of them asked me when was the last time I was personally penetrated, if I liked being penetrated, and how often I got penetrated," Mitchell told Waypoint. "I was furious and felt humiliated so I took the free swag and left."
31/07/2021, 09:28 - Mike: Fucking lol at that cringe
31/07/2021, 09:32 - Mike: @447561062944 what game are we playing for the birthday next week? Paul has already taken aoe2
31/07/2021, 09:36 - Wezz: Dude this timeline is pretty nuts. So all the blizzard madness going on, harassment suits, boycotts etc. Then finding out that a lot of them already jumped ship to riot and are leading management there. Riot getting off scot-free farting in peoples faces
31/07/2021, 09:36 - Wezz: I'm boycotting my own party if we're playing aoe2
31/07/2021, 09:37 - Mike: Too complex to explain people leave jobs, HATE üöÜ HATE üöÜ DOWN WITH BLIZZARD

31/07/2021, 09:42 - Noone: Two big wow YouTubers, madseason and PreachGaming have dropped WoW, Asmongold audience all seeing it too
31/07/2021, 09:42 - Noone: After this and patch 9.1 I feel like WoW is on PURE life support
31/07/2021, 09:45 - Mike: The blizzard Devs could release an update where they personally cum on players and the fan base would still accept it, 8 million players are going nowhere
31/07/2021, 09:46 - Wezz: @447857964894 ?
31/07/2021, 09:47 - Noone: Maybe, but ff14 literally ran out of product keys recently with the exodus from wow, and that was only a week or two after 9.1 patch
31/07/2021, 09:47 - Noone: However short lived that exodus is, it's pretty crazy this early into a new patch cycle
31/07/2021, 09:47 - Dayle: Ff14 is much better than wow its good asmongold started playing it and now everyone sees that
31/07/2021, 09:48 - Mike: "ran out of product keys" sorry, what?
31/07/2021, 09:48 - Mike: "Boss, we've run out of unique random words"
31/07/2021, 09:49 - Noone: There were so many sales of ff14 that they ran out of the guids linked to copies of the game in their online store and had to temporarily stop selling the game
31/07/2021, 09:49 - Dayle: Woah thats nuts
31/07/2021, 09:50 - Mike: You say this about literally every game you video game whore
31/07/2021, 09:50 - Dayle: Yeah well my taste of games is expansive you fucking one to three maybe four game berk
31/07/2021, 09:50 - Derren: Maybe he was just a really enthusiastic pen tester

31/07/2021, 10:03 - Mike: ???
31/07/2021, 10:03 - Wezz: Look, I didn't have to admit that I mistakenly recalled AoE as turn based and 4 hours long
31/07/2021, 10:04 - Wezz: Instead it's the shit sc2 one
31/07/2021, 10:04 - Derren: He gets boosted to max level without understanding how the game works, wipes constantly on every boss then flames the game for being slow and shit
31/07/2021, 10:04 - Mike: ACTIVE TIME MANEUVER
31/07/2021, 10:04 - Derren: Tbh all mmos feel slow to me after playing aion

31/07/2021, 10:06 - Wezz: Have you tried tic tac toe? It's the fastest game I've played this year
31/07/2021, 10:06 - Derren: It's not, aions combat currently is probably the fastest of any mmo
31/07/2021, 10:06 - Derren: It's a shame the rest of it is shit
31/07/2021, 10:07 - Paul: This is surely considered some sort of self-harm

01/08/2021, 10:17 - Kirky: <Media omitted>
01/08/2021, 10:27 - James: I decided early on that I'd stick as the alpha James, and everyone around me was forced to go to surnames, nicknames, or shorter versions of their names
01/08/2021, 10:28 - James: I moved to a new team at work a few years ago, and everyone started called the other James that had been on the team years Jim, it really reinforced my divine right as the true James
01/08/2021, 10:29 - Noone: Thanks for the story, jim
01/08/2021, 10:30 - Noone: Jim 2
01/08/2021, 10:30 - James: Right, kick this heretic

01/08/2021, 11:35 - James: I don't register the things you say
01/08/2021, 12:07 - Nathan: Yeah sounds like something a Beta would say. Sounds like a submissive stance to take
01/08/2021, 12:08 - Paul: Nathan once bench pressed a baby moose
01/08/2021, 12:11 - James: Hey, I said I was the alpha James, I'm not comparing myself to a NATHAN
01/08/2021, 12:13 - Paul: Notoriously Angry Transsexual Hippie Advertising Network
01/08/2021, 12:14 - Paul: Everyone try out final fantasy 14. It's free up to level 60 and it's really awesome even as a solo experience
01/08/2021, 12:16 - Dayle: Agreed
01/08/2021, 12:28 - Wezz: Everyone try out League of Legends. It's free up to level infinite and it's really shit even as a shit experience
01/08/2021, 12:29 - Paul: Agreed except for the try out part
01/08/2021, 13:14 - Nathan: üò≠üò≠
01/08/2021, 16:35 - Mike: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-58045787

Private companies holding news orgs to account, what timeline are we in now?
01/08/2021, 16:36 - Dayle: We have passed the great filter
01/08/2021, 16:41 - Paul: Yeah I'm torn. I hate covid misinformation but I also hate censorship. By principle I'd disagree with its removal I think. Although I think there should probably be laws against news sites reporting factual inaccuracies in the same way you can't lie about a product in an advert.
01/08/2021, 16:42 - Paul: Kinda the same as me finding it hilarious that Twitter banned Trump but at the same time it's scary that they have so much power
01/08/2021, 18:59 - Noone: No matter who you are
01/08/2021, 19:00 - Noone: wether you're a level headed blue blood capitalist like myself
01/08/2021, 19:00 - Noone: or a warp minded communist like paul
01/08/2021, 19:00 - Noone: we can all agree that what Dumbledoor does at the end of the Philosopher's stone is fucking bullshit, Slytherin deserved to win
01/08/2021, 19:01 - Paul: It's actually what Harry meant when he whispered to the hat "not Slytherin" he knew they'd get fucked over
01/08/2021, 19:04 - Lockers: Spoilers ffs
01/08/2021, 19:08 - Kirky: <Media omitted>
01/08/2021, 19:08 - Kirky: nsfl

01/08/2021, 19:10 - Kirky: <Media omitted>
01/08/2021, 19:10 - Kirky: just a gymnast landing badly, both legs bend the wrong way at the knee
01/08/2021, 19:15 - Lockers: No thank you. No need for ptsd ta
01/08/2021, 19:15 - Noone: Kyle's Dad as a dolphin in that episode is a haunting image
01/08/2021, 19:32 - Noone: <Media omitted>
01/08/2021, 19:37 - Dayle: F
01/08/2021, 19:38 - Paul: There's a whole generation growing up now who won't get the "wouldn't download a car" bit
01/08/2021, 19:38 - Noone: Inches from death and hanging 20 meters above a moving steam engine locamotive, the character Harry Potter (played by the actor Daniel Radcliffe) in the 2002 film "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets", feels it necessary to explain to his friend Ronald Weasley (played by the actor Rupert Grint) that the reason he's unable to climb to safety is because "your (Ron's) hand's all sweaty".
01/08/2021, 19:44 - Noone: When Mogonogal threatens both Harry and Ron that she'll be "writing home" to "both your parents", she must know she's being particularly cruel to Harry. She did after all deliver him as an orphaned baby to his uncle and aunt _personally_
01/08/2021, 19:45 - James: McGonagall*
01/08/2021, 19:45 - Noone: you're getting hung up on the cat woman
01/08/2021, 19:46 - James: No, Catwoman is in Batman, I was talking about McGonagall
01/08/2021, 19:48 - Lockers: Fucking mogonogal stold
01/08/2021, 19:48 - Paul: Both your parents meaning literally Molly and Arthur she didn't give a shit about Harry
01/08/2021, 19:50 - Kirky: they both get a letter so they can read it at the same time over breakfast
01/08/2021, 19:51 - Paul: Yes but what about second breakfast?
01/08/2021, 19:53 - Noone: as the Pixies run wild in Lockhart's class, they climb atop some kind of mythical skeleton. As the skeleton is released from its supports and begins falling, one of the pixies sat on top of it yells "yeehaw" as it rides the display all the way to the ground. This would imply that there are cowboy pixies in some part the Harry Potter universe, or that pixies have knowledge of Muggle cowboys
01/08/2021, 19:56 - Paul: 3rd option is that yeehaw is just a universal enjoyment noise that transcends all barriers
01/08/2021, 20:39 - Paul: !thesaurusthis
01/08/2021, 20:40 - Paul: !emojify
01/08/2021, 20:51 - Noone: are there families in the Wizarding world who fuck their house elfs?

01/08/2021, 20:59 - Noone: ah as you can see the bones clearly are NOT broken.
01/08/2021, 20:59 - Noone: BROKEHN! THERE'S NO BONS *LAFT*
01/08/2021, 21:09 - Mike: Why tiny elf when you can giantess Jack
01/08/2021, 21:09 - Noone: TRUE
01/08/2021, 21:36 - Paul: Nah she's too busy fighting the entire transgender community
01/08/2021, 21:38 - Noone: is this because she said calling women "people who menstrate" is retarded?
01/08/2021, 21:40 - Paul: At first it seemed like she was pretty fair with her opinions but apparently recently she's been liking tweets about gay conversion therapy (dunno how true that is) so I dunno
01/08/2021, 21:41 - Noone: ‚ÄúHarry Potter‚Äù author J.K. Rowling is back in the spotlight after stating on Twitter that young people are being ‚Äúshunted towards‚Äù hormones and surgery that may not be in their best interests, and comparing the measures to ‚Äúconversion therapy.‚Äù

‚ÄúMany, myself included, believe we are watching a new kind of conversion therapy for young gay people, who are being set on a lifelong path of medicalization that may result in the loss of their fertility and/or full sexual function,‚Äù Rowling tweeted.

Rowling was responding to a July 4 post by Twitter user @TrinerScot, who called out the author for ‚Äòliking‚Äô a post by Twitter user @Manaxium that claimed hormone prescriptions were ‚Äúthe new antidepressants.‚Äù ‚ÄúYes they are sometimes necessary and lifesaving, but they should be a last resort ‚Äì not the first option. Pure laziness for those who would rather medicate than put in the time and effort to heal people‚Äôs minds,‚Äù
01/08/2021, 21:42 - Noone: never heard about this one, but I think anyone without cum in their head recognises this as being true
01/08/2021, 21:46 - Paul: Ah if that's the context then I take it back and still agree with her
01/08/2021, 21:48 - Paul: If I said this about something you'd flip your lid "anyone who disagrees with me has cum in their head"
01/08/2021, 21:48 - Kirky: <Media omitted>
01/08/2021, 21:49 - Noone: yeah because most of the time you're wrong
01/08/2021, 21:49 - Noone: this has already saved me from being fired 7 times
01/08/2021, 21:50 - Kirky: "But your Honor, I identify as black so it cant be a hate crime"
01/08/2021, 22:00 - Noone: hate crimes only apply to people, and as we all know- muslims aren't people
02/08/2021, 08:38 - Noone: <Media omitted>
02/08/2021, 08:40 - Paul: Tbf they haven't rolled up the headphones just the cable

02/08/2021, 09:05 - Paul: Happy Monday everyone have a great week! Remember: it's not about the goal it's about the journey. Be proud of yourselves just for trying.
02/08/2021, 09:05 - James: I don't miss this part of office working, having all my shit regularly moved around and having to hunt random bits down the cleaners decided no longer wanted to be on my desk
02/08/2021, 09:05 - James: Shut the fuck up you pious preacher man
02/08/2021, 09:05 - Derren: What if I'm not trying
02/08/2021, 09:05 - Derren: Keep your desk clean and organised you animal
02/08/2021, 09:06 - Paul: Be proud of yourself for being so introspective and open
02/08/2021, 09:06 - Mike: <Media omitted>
02/08/2021, 09:06 - James: I'm sorry for having my mug and a M+KB on my desk, I'll be better in the future
02/08/2021, 09:06 - James: I'm imagining it's greasy
02/08/2021, 09:06 - Derren: I'd want to move your desk around if I saw your mug on it too
02/08/2021, 09:07 - Paul: Now now lads let's keep it cordial
02/08/2021, 09:07 - James: Right that's it, fucking let's take it outside mate
02/08/2021, 09:07 - Derren: What are we taking outside
02/08/2021, 09:08 - Paul: I've known James a long time. Don't worry he's almost certainly joking and actually likes you a lot
02/08/2021, 09:08 - Derren: I'm inclined to DISAGREE
02/08/2021, 09:09 - James: That sweet ass of yours
02/08/2021, 09:10 - Derren: Sounds gay, I'm not here for that

02/08/2021, 11:20 - Paul: Did we not go to Dachau when you were here?
02/08/2021, 11:20 - Mike: Na too sad, fuck history
02/08/2021, 11:20 - Paul: Ah right, because it walks you through the entire rise of the Nazi's, it's super fascinating. It lays it out in a way where you can really see how it would have convinced people
02/08/2021, 11:40 - Noone: Qck are you aware of how much you sound like Daniel Day-Lewis? Is this on purpose? Or perhaps even on porpoise?
02/08/2021, 11:46 - Mike: They don't call Qck Daniel Night-Lewis for nothing
02/08/2021, 11:53 - Lockers: Can you tell which one is spelt correctly?
02/08/2021, 12:07 - Noone: Daniel Day-Lewis or Samuel Day-Lewis
02/08/2021, 12:12 - Dayle: <Media omitted>

02/08/2021, 15:31 - Noone: Here's how the travel trafic light system works.
Green: You're a dickhead for travelling but you don't have to feel guilty about it
Yellow: Don't travel
Red: Don't travel
02/08/2021, 15:31 - Dayle: I'm going majorca end of the month
02/08/2021, 15:32 - Paul: Wow I didn't think you disliked traffic lights so much
02/08/2021, 16:42 - Wezz: You forgot the crucial *Amber+*, which also conveniently means don't travel
02/08/2021, 16:43 - Dayle: yeah really hoping spain doesnt go on amber+ but the cases are dropping more and more and france is coming off it so i think it will be fine
02/08/2021, 16:47 - Wezz: ü§ûüèøü§ûüèøü§ûüèøü§ûüèø
02/08/2021, 19:42 - Qck: Girlfriend shut this one down pretty quickly, but the brief ego boost is enough to carry me through the week

03/08/2021, 11:12 - Dayle: gonna do some squats
03/08/2021, 11:13 - Kirky: <Media omitted>
03/08/2021, 11:13 - Kirky: How long left ?
03/08/2021, 11:14 - Dayle: 19 days
03/08/2021, 11:15 - James: It's like 2012, we're burning to death and out corpses are freezing the next day. Crazy
03/08/2021, 11:16 - Dayle: bro how its 18 here :|Z
03/08/2021, 11:37 - Derren: Did you go nuts and drive to russia?
03/08/2021, 12:23 - Wezz: Since it's my birthday, can we all agree that two of the most overated bands of all time are:
Queen and Foo Fighters

Throw Metalica in there while we're at it.

Any additions?
03/08/2021, 12:23 - Wezz: #fightme
03/08/2021, 12:24 - Dayle: Agreed
03/08/2021, 12:37 - Paul: Wezz having a contrarian opinion? I'm shocked
03/08/2021, 12:39 - Paul: Queen were entertainers who played stadium music. Freddie was a virtuosic vocalist, especially compared to his rock peers. Seems like a great recipe for popularity to me
03/08/2021, 12:40 - Paul: Foo fighters play fun music. I've never seen people worship them though. Their level of fame seems to match their catchiness to me
03/08/2021, 12:41 - Paul: Metallica are kinda ok if you get past Enter Sandman and Master of Puppets
03/08/2021, 12:42 - Paul: That whole thread was just teenagers who heard 2 Beatles songs saying they are trash
03/08/2021, 12:51 - Wezz: The key word is 'Overrated'. I think Metalica is interesting cause they had a whole fashion appeal too (people wearing Metallica tees without even listening to the band). Same thing Pink Floyd dealt with.

But Foo Fighters are high school rock who are massively overrated imo. Their 3-4 hits are decent but all similar with the album tracks being mediocre. The fact they headline so often is embarrassing.

Queen for performance; sure. But they're held to such high regard (top 10 band in the world?) and their music just isn't that interesting.
03/08/2021, 12:52 - Dayle: Blue the band all snagged each other on a tour bus so they are fucked as well I want to add them to the list
03/08/2021, 13:03 - Wezz: Queen, Foo Fighters, Metallica, Blue
03/08/2021, 13:03 - Paul: You could do this exact same thing with any popular band pretty easily
03/08/2021, 13:04 - Paul: What the metric for overrated? Whether or not they "deserve" the praise? It's impossible to quantify
03/08/2021, 13:04 - James: Does anyone deserve fame?
03/08/2021, 13:04 - Paul: Only me on my bday
03/08/2021, 13:04 - James: If it's for the art, then we should all submit to a centralised label that is distributed to all
03/08/2021, 13:04 - James: Hammer and Sickle Records
03/08/2021, 13:05 - Paul: Has a certain respectability to it rather than manufactured for profit pop bands
03/08/2021, 13:29 - Qck: Metallica are great if you get over Lars' snare
03/08/2021, 13:29 - Qck: Echoing Piper's birthday sentiment
03/08/2021, 13:29 - Alex: St anger is a tune
03/08/2021, 13:30 - Qck: Yeah and Lars' snare is in tune with my ass
03/08/2021, 13:30 - Alex: You want Lars to tap that?
03/08/2021, 13:31 - Wezz: It's always the Queen fans that deconstruct definitions first.

Y'know what overated means... e.g. you're overrated at CS:GO
03/08/2021, 13:32 - Qck: Rather have Kirk tapping out facemelting solos on my taint
03/08/2021, 13:32 - Qck: Queen are shit and overrated btw Paul
03/08/2021, 13:34 - Wezz: Happy birthday; Queen are average.
03/08/2021, 13:34 - Alex: Their first 6 albums are all masterpieces, but then they have like 10more which each have at least one good song and a lot of dross
03/08/2021, 13:35 - Qck: News of the World isn't even a masterpiece they're shite
03/08/2021, 13:35 - Qck: Not a good album in sight, just singles that are made for the royal variety show
03/08/2021, 13:35 - Qck: Fuck off Queen
03/08/2021, 13:36 - Alex: I know this is banter, but that's too far. It's late is awesome and it's a great album
03/08/2021, 13:37 - Qck: It's not banter they're a shit band and all contemporary critics agreed, all their shit was critically panned but commercially successful
03/08/2021, 13:37 - Alex: Contemporary critics.... you?
03/08/2021, 13:37 - Qck: Brian May can keep climbing on buildings unannounced and ripping out the we will rock you solo but it doesn't change the fact that the talented one is dead from monkey aids
03/08/2021, 13:38 - Qck: Look at how news of the world was rated by rolling stone, christgau et all, nobody likes queen bro
03/08/2021, 13:38 - Qck: Only faggots like Paul who don't listen to albums
03/08/2021, 13:45 - Wezz: Queen is the ultimate 'settle on' band. When you don't listen to enough variety of music on your own, you settle on your Dad's favourite band
03/08/2021, 13:46 - Alex: I know this is a new bold way of thinking, how about they can be in the middle somewhere? Instead of all or nothing....
03/08/2021, 13:46 - James: Compromise? In my Whatsapp group?
03/08/2021, 13:47 - Qck: "I buy my music merch from Primark" band
03/08/2021, 13:47 - Qck: Yeah I'm not happy unless Jack and Paul are reaching meltdown levels of spaghetti
03/08/2021, 13:48 - James: I think the point here is it's 'my special music taste' versus the masses. They wouldn't have been popular, or have the legacy they had today if they they weren't incredible at what they did. Perhaps what they did wasn't controversial enough for some of the people in this chat to consider them artists, but people don't become a defining sound of an era by accident with a few pop songs.
03/08/2021, 13:49 - Wezz: I was clear on my intentions from the off lol
03/08/2021, 13:54 - Qck: Nah James, Queen are just shite
03/08/2021, 13:54 - James: Touch√©
03/08/2021, 13:55 - Mike: What do you know of music? James has had 4 top tens in the UK charts mate
03/08/2021, 13:55 - Paul: +1
03/08/2021, 13:55 - Qck: I know that Queen's most famous live song is Freddie doing some vocal warmups
03/08/2021, 13:56 - Qck: aAaaaaaaOoOoooooo AaAaEeeeOoooOooo
03/08/2021, 13:56 - Alex: Oh I love this one
03/08/2021, 13:56 - James: I see what this is now. You're upset because Freddie didn't wait around to fuck you
03/08/2021, 13:57 - Wezz: When we take these middling stances we miss out on all the sexy details. The music industry isn't a meritocracy, that's why we get shit like Who Let The Dogs Out top the charts for multiple weeks
03/08/2021, 13:57 - Wezz: James isn't the best James I know
03/08/2021, 13:57 - James: Poor example, implying who let the dogs out isn't a banger
03/08/2021, 13:57 - James: You're damn fucking lucky it's your birthday boy
03/08/2021, 13:57 - Mike: Now hes attacking another national treasure?!
03/08/2021, 13:58 - James: This chat has really gone to the dogs
03/08/2021, 13:58 - Wezz: Yippie yi yo
03/08/2021, 13:58 - Mike: *holds James, holder of 4 top ten hits, back*
03/08/2021, 13:58 - Alex: This is something we can all agree on
03/08/2021, 13:58 - James: WOOF WOOF WOOF-WOOF
03/08/2021, 13:58 - Qck: Bad example of what a meritocracy isn't

who let the dogs out got best new music on p4k
03/08/2021, 13:59 - Qck: And also pretty sure Brian May is one of the dogs in the video
03/08/2021, 14:10 - Wezz: Well, it was even further from a meritocracy back then with labels ruling the roost. Advertising budget is always gonna play a big role in who gets playtime/exposure. Internet helps level the field but I think it's a long way from 'fair'
03/08/2021, 14:10 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
03/08/2021, 14:10 - James: üòÇ
03/08/2021, 14:10 - Qck: Lmao
03/08/2021, 14:12 - Paul: Careful Wezz, Sam is invoking Christgau as his reason that Queen are shit, who pretty notoriously said the Libertines were dog shit
03/08/2021, 14:13 - Qck: He also said King Crimson is an ersatz Pink Floyd (which isn't true but is fucking funny), doesn't mean his opinions are doo-doo on arrival
03/08/2021, 14:14 - Paul: Just means that critics are vulnerable to the same biases as everyone and we shouldn't revere their opinions aimlessly
03/08/2021, 14:14 - Lockers: How did this go from Dayle doing bored squats to this
03/08/2021, 14:15 - Dayle: I have that much impact
03/08/2021, 14:16 - Wezz: He did the Rolling Stones reviews.. massive pinch of salt with any 'critic'. But in the end he rated them pretty highly IIRC
03/08/2021, 14:16 - Lockers: This should be a lesson to you
03/08/2021, 14:16 - Qck: Queen are the epitome of mediocre 70s tripe, talking heads were releasing 77 when queen were doing we will rock you

Love to see you do a couple of reaction vids to some queen albums though to see if you actually would enjoy them
03/08/2021, 14:17 - Paul: Albums = only true music. Noses up guys its snobbery all the way to the bank
03/08/2021, 14:17 - Qck: Thanks for mansplaining to me
03/08/2021, 14:18 - Qck: I think it's hard to have an informed opinion on a band's musical output without having listened to an album of theirs yeah
03/08/2021, 14:19 - Wezz: *DUM DUM TSH, DUM DUM TSH, DUM DUM TSH*
03/08/2021, 14:19 - Qck: And I think most people who listen to a few Queen albums without it being in a vacuum will say that they're fucking shite
03/08/2021, 14:19 - Qck: AAaaaeEeeeeOoooOooooooOo
03/08/2021, 14:20 - Paul: Gotta be done sometimes
03/08/2021, 14:20 - James: It's easy to say something like this knowing that due to their cultural penetration it's impossible to prove
03/08/2021, 14:20 - Paul: Also this is implying I don't own a bunch of their albums
03/08/2021, 14:21 - Paul: Which is this whole discussion like I said at the start
03/08/2021, 14:21 - James: Come on Paul, we all know that only top tier music aficionados have even heard of albums, let alone own them
03/08/2021, 14:21 - Wezz: _Woooooah_, top 10 sound right there
03/08/2021, 14:22 - Qck: <Media omitted>
03/08/2021, 14:23 - James: "OOOH LOOK AT ME GUYS, I LISTEN TO BLACK MUSIC"
03/08/2021, 14:23 - James: Get over yourself Sam
03/08/2021, 14:23 - Qck: That's Brian May
03/08/2021, 14:23 - Paul: James your music used to sound like Optimus Prime orgasms tbf
03/08/2021, 14:24 - James: Right, I'm switching teams, Queen are fucking hacks
03/08/2021, 14:24 - Paul: lmao
03/08/2021, 14:25 - James: What have the birthday boys been up to today then?
03/08/2021, 14:25 - Paul: Taking it very easy and going to an irish pub later
03/08/2021, 14:27 - James: Is it the one we went to for Karaoke?
03/08/2021, 14:32 - Paul: nah similar though
03/08/2021, 14:34 - Wezz: Went for a run in the morning, then mostly flaming Queen online in the afternoon.
03/08/2021, 14:34 - Wezz: It's been a great day
03/08/2021, 14:36 - Kirky: YOU RAN?
03/08/2021, 14:38 - Wezz: Cheeky 20 minute HIIT mate - had to do something to counter the abundance of cake and beer later in the week
03/08/2021, 14:38 - Kirky: NICE
03/08/2021, 14:38 - Kirky: so did i lol
03/08/2021, 14:40 - Paul: Hugely Ineffective Inebriated Training
03/08/2021, 15:10 - Alex: You are a flaming queen
03/08/2021, 15:11 - Dayle: yaaaaaaaaaas QUEEN
03/08/2021, 15:17 - Lockers: Young and free?

03/08/2021, 18:38 - Lockers: Video games are for nerds though lol

03/08/2021, 18:49 - Lee: I want to do a kickflip
03/08/2021, 18:50 - Paul: Did everyone here know Marge was originally going to have bunny ears and they were going to reveal them at the end?
03/08/2021, 18:50 - Noone: #??///////////////////////////////
03/08/2021, 18:54 - Derren: You can still do a kick flip on a longboard
03/08/2021, 18:54 - Lockers: I can flipping kick you if you want, got a degree in it
03/08/2021, 18:54 - Noone: LOL
03/08/2021, 18:56 - Derren: @447882977703   https://youtu.be/P-rBND5pOms?t=545 we could be like this!
03/08/2021, 19:02 - Lee: But I don't wanna be a woman

03/08/2021, 19:12 - Derren: What a joke of a country we live in
03/08/2021, 19:12 - James: Free pizza? Sounds like the best country you mean
03/08/2021, 19:13 - Paul: <Media omitted>
03/08/2021, 19:13 - Lockers: Julia's reaction when she heads free pizza

03/08/2021, 19:18 - Lockers: LOL MASSIVE NOSE DEREK
03/08/2021, 19:26 - Wezz: I THOUGHT YOU'D NEVER ASK üòÑ
03/08/2021, 19:26 - Wezz: Nah I'm alright thanks, I'll definitely watch you break your ankles though. Take you to A&E
03/08/2021, 19:29 - Wezz: I thought he was yours this year? Be sure to water him, just leave his nose alone for now
03/08/2021, 19:42 - Derren: üëÉ
03/08/2021, 20:42 - Paul: Who's everyone's favourite batman actor?
03/08/2021, 20:46 - Noone: Heath Ledger RIP
03/08/2021, 20:46 - Noone: RIP Heath Ledger RIP
03/08/2021, 20:52 - Dayle: Jack nickleson as joker and cristian bale as batman
03/08/2021, 20:52 - Dayle: Perhaps the new shiny guy as the trailer looks fucking sick
03/08/2021, 20:53 - Noone: Heath Ledger as Joker and Heath Ledger as Batman and Heath Ledger as Dayle Brearley
03/08/2021, 20:54 - Derren: Jack you sure your fav batman actor isn't Tom Hardy
03/08/2021, 21:09 - Noone: Tom Hardy isn't an actor
03/08/2021, 21:18 - Noone: he is
03/08/2021, 21:18 - Noone: an _actor_
03/08/2021, 21:21 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
03/08/2021, 22:14 - Derren: You bored
03/08/2021, 22:17 - James: This is art
03/08/2021, 22:58 - Lee: Best thing I've ever seen
04/08/2021, 07:56 - Paul: Wow it's a masterpiece thanks wezz but careful about revealing my identity
04/08/2021, 09:07 - Noone: Sky brown won bronze in the women's skateboarding, youngest ever British athlete to earn a medal what a legend ü•âü•âü•âü•â
04/08/2021, 09:10 - Derren: Child abuse
04/08/2021, 09:24 - Noone: you're right she should have been wearing a burka
04/08/2021, 09:58 - Lockers: <Media omitted>
04/08/2021, 09:58 - James: That you're a man of taste
04/08/2021, 10:11 - Lee: Spoilers!
04/08/2021, 10:11 - Lee: I actually forgot I wasn't going to come in this chat today.
04/08/2021, 10:27 - Lockers: Mate if you go onto any social media or news it's a spoiler. Only one I managed to avoid was the bmx freestyle, that was really good
04/08/2021, 11:26 - Derren: <Media omitted>
04/08/2021, 11:38 - Dayle: Check the headers and see where its from ü§£ü§£
04/08/2021, 12:17 - Wezz: Oh you're a bastard. Was looking forward to watching that
04/08/2021, 12:19 - Wezz: Exactlyyy, worst birthday present ever
04/08/2021, 12:28 - Qck: Briefly thought this was Sky Brown
04/08/2021, 12:43 - Wezz: looool.

For those who wanna watch the whole Womens Skateboarding finals:
https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p09pjzvm/olympics-skateboarding-womens-park-final
04/08/2021, 12:57 - Lockers: Whilst this is impressive, these events really highlight the gap between men and women in pure power and a bit skill
04/08/2021, 12:58 - Dayle: We should turn all of this into a youtube channel
04/08/2021, 13:00 - Wezz: Yeah, I love the vibes though so far for all the skateboarding events. Charismatic competitors, feels fresh!
04/08/2021, 13:08 - Mike: It's called the Olympics mate it has its own channel
04/08/2021, 13:14 - Dayle: Nah I mean our tom foolery
04/08/2021, 13:19 - James: I've been watching the Olympics on Olympics, most of the time it's a shit channel but once every few year they have some real programming gold
04/08/2021, 13:20 - Lockers: Think it's quite a niche market m8
04/08/2021, 16:55 - Noone: mate at work made this, what you guys think?https://open.spotify.com/track/0HAvC5h2gyEB75RwOAuBUO?si=be85a478bc1f4de9
04/08/2021, 17:09 - Wezz: On the scale of Jack Noone's friends songs, it's at the bottom for me
04/08/2021, 17:10 - Lockers: I think your mate needs to look up phone contracts with unlimited data
04/08/2021, 17:10 - Noone: true he does
04/08/2021, 17:47 - Derren: <Media omitted>
04/08/2021, 17:49 - Nathan: üì∏ added to the wank bank
04/08/2021, 18:00 - Mike: Do you want to be haunted? That's how you get haunted
04/08/2021, 18:04 - Mike: Colleague at work brought up a similar post he'd seen as the reason he didn't want to get the vaccine, these shitposts do work
04/08/2021, 18:05 - Derren: funny thing is the person sharing this smokes like 10 cigs a day and goes out drinking very often
04/08/2021, 18:07 - Wezz: Was it Mike?
04/08/2021, 18:07 - Derren: More like you, always sweating when you're out
04/08/2021, 18:08 - Mike: I share counter bullshit, "I got the vaccine and my penis grew 2 inches! Thanks $cience!"
04/08/2021, 18:08 - Lockers: What's the matter with drinking often huh?!
04/08/2021, 18:09 - Lockers: That's an erection bro, if you stopped drinking you'd experience one more often
04/08/2021, 18:13 - Wezz: Just pleased they'll let me around schools again tbh
04/08/2021, 18:13 - Derren: üëÄ
04/08/2021, 18:15 - Mike: Worst 30 seconds my life, least me and wezz were near that school.
04/08/2021, 18:16 - Wezz: Still couldn't beat Lockers in the job interviews.. soggy biscuit champion and now they call him Sir
04/08/2021, 18:19 - Lockers: Doesn't matter if you provide the biscuit
04/08/2021, 18:26 - Kirky: but jack this biscuits already soggy! oh sorry that was my after lunch snack
04/08/2021, 18:27 - Noone: Sorry I didn't know I had to bring my own biscuit
04/08/2021, 18:44 - Kirky: https://www.cdkeys.com/age-of-empires-ii-2-definitive-edition-steam-pc is this the right game?
04/08/2021, 19:21 - Kirky: P L E A S E R E S P O N D
04/08/2021, 19:22 - Lockers: Nah I don't think it is m8 sorry
04/08/2021, 19:26 - Dayle: <Media omitted>
04/08/2021, 19:26 - Dayle: thats the one i have
04/08/2021, 19:38 - Nathan: Oh is this for Friday?
04/08/2021, 19:57 - Paul: I dunno if you can play if you've got different versions can someone find out? I don't wanna force people to play it if they don't want to lol
04/08/2021, 19:57 - Paul: Wezz seemed very against it
04/08/2021, 19:58 - Mike: https://www.kinguin.net/category/71108/age-of-empires-ii-definitive-edition-steam-cd-key

and well done for letting paul know, fuck nuts
04/08/2021, 19:59 - Kirky: i mean
04/08/2021, 19:59 - Kirky: that was literally his suggestion? how would he not already know
04/08/2021, 19:59 - Paul: Lmao guys don't fight I love you all
04/08/2021, 19:59 - Paul: Except Mike and Kirky
04/08/2021, 20:01 - Kirky: sorry for ruining the suprise i guess fuck you
04/08/2021, 20:01 - Paul: Bear down for bread for swimming dogs
04/08/2021, 20:02 - Wezz: I haven't been this confused since Dayle's meme
04/08/2021, 20:02 - Mike: I was imagining Paul's face as he logs in on Friday and we're all playing league, only to slowly drift the conversation into AoE2 talk
04/08/2021, 20:02 - Mike: then we go back to league just as he starts to become interested and ban him from Discord
04/08/2021, 20:03 - Paul: As the elders foretold
04/08/2021, 20:03 - Paul: Jack Paul Paul Jack Paul
04/08/2021, 20:03 - Kirky: sounds like a perfect night
04/08/2021, 20:13 - Noone: <Media omitted>
04/08/2021, 20:17 - Dayle: <Media omitted>
04/08/2021, 20:42 - Derren: So which aoe are we buying
04/08/2021, 20:44 - Kirky: bought mikes kinguin link
04/08/2021, 20:55 - Noone: <Media omitted>
04/08/2021, 20:56 - Derren: Jesus
04/08/2021, 20:56 - Kirky: a rapist being jailed with women
04/08/2021, 20:56 - Derren: Women can be rapists too
04/08/2021, 20:56 - Derren: But an oap with dementia god damn this guy is fucked up
04/08/2021, 20:56 - Noone: especially if they were born as men
04/08/2021, 20:57 - Kirky: its his mum
04/08/2021, 20:57 - Lockers: Apparently this isn't true
04/08/2021, 20:57 - Noone: sorry to think we'll never get another installment of Sonichu. Now that Chris is in jail, the internet will be forever a much emptier place.
04/08/2021, 21:03 - Dayle: Bro, can we just line up these weirdos and just bin them üôÑ
04/08/2021, 21:18 - Wezz: I think I'd rather be raped with a cock than a fist tbh
04/08/2021, 21:21 - Wezz: Above comment in reference to this. Are all the women rapists kept together? Do they rape each other? Penatrative rape? Is it just a big fist-a-thon? So many questions.
04/08/2021, 21:22 - Wezz: My new alarm clock üî•üî•
04/08/2021, 21:25 - Mike: Thought you could slip a daily fail in huh Jack?
04/08/2021, 21:25 - Mike: Save us some time and retire to Cornwall already
04/08/2021, 21:26 - Lockers: You can't rape without a penis
04/08/2021, 21:26 - Mike: Also who is Chris Chan
04/08/2021, 21:26 - Lockers: Only way you can be
04/08/2021, 21:27 - Dayle: National treasure film reminder... all 3 bang
04/08/2021, 21:29 - Dayle: Omfg there are only 2, Mandela effect
04/08/2021, 21:29 - Derren: <Media omitted>
04/08/2021, 21:29 - James: For AoE2, it is the definitive edition we talked about yeah
04/08/2021, 21:31 - Kirky: STOP SPOILING IT FOR PAUL
04/08/2021, 21:31 - James: The horse has already bolted
04/08/2021, 21:31 - James: You were a good postman and delivered a steaming spoiler Kirky
04/08/2021, 21:37 - Derren: Postman delivering stuff early?
04/08/2021, 21:37 - Derren: Give him a raise
04/08/2021, 21:38 - James: Yeah, I imagine you're the sort of postman that is supposed to come a 1pm, but instead knocks as I'm dropping a turd at 11:30
04/08/2021, 21:41 - Derren: Ah the dickhead scheduled postman who fucks your day up
04/08/2021, 21:44 - Wezz: I'm picturing you as some guy who's been penetrated by a Pritt stick and the judge says "only penises can rape" and it's left you with deep emotional scars that will never heal
04/08/2021, 21:44 - Kirky: Royal mail dont offer timed delivery slots so dont blame that on me
04/08/2021, 21:46 - Wezz: Jack's friend, he sung that song he posted earlier.
04/08/2021, 21:47 - James: I don't see companies, I'm not postist, you're all the same to me
04/08/2021, 21:48 - Lockers: Nah had a debate with a friend of mine who studies law. I was fuming but it's just linguistics
04/08/2021, 21:49 - Paul: Tweet screenshot about a daily mail article isn't that inspiring but I don't care enough to fact check
04/08/2021, 22:27 - Paul: You guys reckon usain bolts 9.58 is the fastest 100m that's ever been run in all history by a human?
04/08/2021, 22:28 - Dayle: Nope
04/08/2021, 22:28 - Wezz: what even _is_ running?
04/08/2021, 22:29 - Paul: I wonder if he's ever beaten it in training just like on a really good day
04/08/2021, 22:30 - Lockers: Nah man, hunters on cocaine
04/08/2021, 22:31 - Wezz: Pretty sure I've beaten it when I can see the bus coming but I'm 100m from the bus stop
04/08/2021, 22:34 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
04/08/2021, 22:36 - Dayle: Pushing somthing in to fruition is a thing I guess, if you try hard enough it will eventually happen, unless your a fucking mute
04/08/2021, 22:37 - Paul: You can't possibly believe this
04/08/2021, 22:37 - Paul: Also you're
04/08/2021, 22:37 - Wezz: Survivorship bias playing a role I think, prob find a load of psycho girls "yOuLL HeAR Me iN ThE COFFEE ahhhhHh"
04/08/2021, 22:38 - Dayle: I do actually, if you don't do it, it won't happen. Somthing like you miss all the shots you don't take. In the simplist form
04/08/2021, 22:39 - Paul: Do you think all the other failed talented artists just didn't try hard enough?
04/08/2021, 22:39 - Noone: yes, they didn't want it enough
04/08/2021, 22:39 - Dayle: No they just didn't try hard enough in somthing they actually could succeed in
04/08/2021, 22:39 - Noone: they didn't try hard enough at rolling the 6 instead of the 1
04/08/2021, 22:40 - Dayle: Its like me trying to be a singer I won't ever become a fucking boy band singer as I'm dog shit at singing but trying hard at me becoming a singer won't reward me in ways that other things I want would, you can do multiple things and succeed at one
04/08/2021, 22:41 - Dayle: Like you have been to school since you went to nursery you good yet BRUH?
04/08/2021, 22:41 - Dayle: <Media omitted>
04/08/2021, 22:42 - Paul: Oh I see now thanks for the clearer explanation
04/08/2021, 22:49 - Noone: Dayle: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Jh0EN1De4Q
04/08/2021, 22:50 - Dayle: I have been homeless and addicted to drugs and I'm doing very well for my self, but thanks for the reference to this stupid cunt much lol such wow, back to memes for you
04/08/2021, 22:52 - Dayle: Just can't nail your or you are though its a thoughfy haha
04/08/2021, 22:53 - Wezz: It's true that without setting yourself goals/a plan. Your likelyhood to achieve anything of that magnitude is insanely unlikely. As opposed to incredibly unlikely if you do
04/08/2021, 22:56 - Mike: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-JgG0ECp2U&ab_channel=TeamCoco

Bo quotes time again
04/08/2021, 22:56 - Wezz: The easiest route is being deafist and self-fullfilling, cause you're always right then.
04/08/2021, 22:58 - Wezz: I liked that when it was posted, sure I sent it to you too. Anyway his point and schtick is survivorship bias
04/08/2021, 23:02 - Wezz: Obv he massively lucked into fame posting on YouTube, one of the chosen ones etc. But the advice for the average person looking to succeed is the same ole shi: 'make a plan', 'start small'.

Or just do the gaga method YOLO
04/08/2021, 23:07 - Mike: I need that "make my exes regret" fame
04/08/2021, 23:09 - Wezz: Fuck monies. If the opportunity ever arises, I will be your pseudo-butler for the day.
05/08/2021, 00:09 - Wezz: Some guy has climbed ontop of the Aria in Vegas to protest the Nevada mask mandate, bonkers https://www.reddit.com/r/vegas/comments/oxxjac/anti_mask_protester_climbs_aria/
05/08/2021, 01:12 - Qck: Boo-urns!
05/08/2021, 01:16 - Derren: Go to sleep
05/08/2021, 01:17 - Qck: I'm in Devon atm
05/08/2021, 01:21 - Wezz: No sleep; Mens skateboarding
https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p09pjzsk/olympics-day-13-bbc-one-skateboarding
05/08/2021, 01:24 - Qck: Basketball semis on later too, but I'm way too slaughtered to bother watching
05/08/2021, 01:24 - Qck: Just tell Jack not to spoil it for me
05/08/2021, 10:33 - Mike: <Media omitted>
05/08/2021, 10:38 - James: I could have used that reason code living with Paul to be honest
05/08/2021, 10:38 - Paul: I made your food
05/08/2021, 10:41 - James: You barely made your own food Paul
05/08/2021, 10:41 - James: Remember I've seen you at your weakest moment
05/08/2021, 10:42 - Paul: I made your food in Devon
05/08/2021, 10:43 - James: We've never been to Devon together Paul. Nurse, I need you to take him back to his room again
05/08/2021, 10:43 - Paul: I'm in Devon
05/08/2021, 10:43 - James: NURSE!
05/08/2021, 10:44 - Paul: Are you my grandson Nathan?
05/08/2021, 10:48 - Paul: Bob Hayes ran 100m in 8.5s back in 1964 as the fastest recorded 100m split as part of the relay race. So there we have it.
05/08/2021, 10:48 - James: Yes Paul, Bob is the fastest man in the world. WHERE IS THE NURSE?!
05/08/2021, 11:46 - Nathan: No I'm Nathan!
05/08/2021, 11:48 - Paul: You're the man from my dreams! NURSE
05/08/2021, 11:49 - Wezz: Is that with a running start? Kinda cheating
05/08/2021, 11:53 - James: Yeah, I could run 100m if I was shot from a cannon Paul, respect the specifics of the format
05/08/2021, 11:56 - Paul: Under my parameters I think it fits. Bolt did a 8.78s as his relay split so pretty close
05/08/2021, 11:57 - James: Why didn't Bob Hayes run the 100m sprint then, huh?
05/08/2021, 11:58 - Paul: He did he won a gold medal
05/08/2021, 11:58 - Qck: He did, he ran a 9.9 that wasn't official 4 years before anyone else
05/08/2021, 11:59 - James: Then Bolt was still faster with 9.58?
05/08/2021, 11:59 - Paul: Not than his relay 100m split
05/08/2021, 12:00 - Wezz: _tears down Usain Bolt poster_
05/08/2021, 12:00 - James: Yeah, but that's a different format, Usain Bold doesn't hold the world record for fastest 100m split
05/08/2021, 12:00 - James: BOLD
05/08/2021, 12:00 - James: *BOLD*
05/08/2021, 12:00 - Qck: Yeah and he would have ran a relay faster, this is in the days of handtiming black athletes in clogs
05/08/2021, 12:00 - Paul: My original comment was just asking if bolt had run the fastest ever 100m of all time with his 9.58
05/08/2021, 12:05 - James: You can make a D&D character that can run the 100m sprint in 0.36 seconds
05/08/2021, 12:06 - Wezz: Poor defined, just like the science you study. I'm proud ü•≤
05/08/2021, 12:06 - Dayle: <Media omitted>
05/08/2021, 12:06 - Wezz: Poorly* FUCK
05/08/2021, 12:06 - Wezz: This is the science I come here for
05/08/2021, 12:07 - Paul: I think the parameters are very clearly defined. They are just broad. Noob
05/08/2021, 12:10 - Wezz: Let's just deconstruct to the point of irrelevance and all be correct. What is 'definition'?
05/08/2021, 12:10 - James: How do you define 'define'?
05/08/2021, 12:10 - Paul: It's when you dislike Queen
05/08/2021, 12:11 - Wezz: ALEXA what am I?

_NURSE!_
05/08/2021, 12:11 - Mike: Light can travel the 100m in 0.00000033 seconds so idk why we're sucking up to this dude
05/08/2021, 12:13 - Paul: Only in a vacuum like a weak retard
05/08/2021, 12:13 - Wezz: Yeah fuck off, Paralympic light shit
05/08/2021, 12:13 - Mike: <Media omitted>
05/08/2021, 12:13 - Wezz: What a fun bit of work banter, that's some lemon and herb shit right there
05/08/2021, 12:13 - Paul: Looks fine to me
05/08/2021, 12:14 - James: Is it worth it? Let me work it
I put my surname down, flip it and reverse it
05/08/2021, 12:14 - Mike: Hi {string.Reverse(p.surname)},
05/08/2021, 12:14 - Paul: üòÇ
05/08/2021, 12:33 - Wezz: About to buy and download AoE2. The one Mike linked is the Definitive Edition. Is that what you have @447835575116 ?
05/08/2021, 12:38 - Mike: Don't think he has any yet, that's the one most people had though
05/08/2021, 12:38 - Mike: Or at least it's the latest one
05/08/2021, 12:43 - Wezz: Cool, got it from: https://www.cdkeys.com/pc/games/age-of-empires-ii-2-definitive-edition-steam-pc for ¬£8

No idea how to play.
05/08/2021, 12:52 - Wezz: Wanted to pick Uno Flip for my game, but it's only max 4 players.

05/08/2021, 21:29 - Wezz: League is 100% a strategy game with fighting elements. It's a boring game if you play it properly, that's why yolo 1v9 noscope flashbang pow

06/08/2021, 09:17 - Mike: We had a "meet the directors" break out groups at work where they asked this, I answered first and said mustard I guess. They then clarified they meant nandos condiment lol
06/08/2021, 09:26 - Wezz: The more I hear about your job the more it sounds like a cult.
"Great spicy meeting guys, don't forget our daily Zoom @ 12 to pray to the Nandos deities with our SA brothers!"
06/08/2021, 09:31 - James: I'm imagining an immediate hushed silence, a few of the Elder Chickenistas exchange glances, and the spicy helpers emerge from the shadows to hold Mike down. One produces a XTRA HOT sauce bottle from his cloak, and begins forcing it down Mike's throat. After a few seconds of forced gargling the meeting continues in the background as the struggling slows.

06/08/2021, 09:34 - James: Sex sells Sam

06/08/2021, 09:39 - Wezz: I mean, look at that dirty nozzle - needs a good clean rimming.

...I think we're giving Mike PTSD from his slutty shill induction
06/08/2021, 09:40 - Mike: Honestly it does feel like that a bit
06/08/2021, 09:41 - Wezz: I mean, when they ask you what seems like an 'icebreaker' question. And then they shame you for not being a corporate shill. That's when I checkout of the meeting mentally lol
06/08/2021, 09:41 - Wezz: I like Mayonaise.
06/08/2021, 09:41 - Wezz: HELLMANS Mayonaise
06/08/2021, 09:42 - Mike: Yeh but they upped my free lunch limit to 5 days a week, I LOVE LEMON AND HERB
06/08/2021, 09:42 - Wezz: "You mean Perinaise Mike?"
06/08/2021, 09:43 - James: I'd shill for that tbf

06/08/2021, 09:52 - Wezz: Ooo, what did you think? Taste like garlic and oil right lol
06/08/2021, 09:52 - Dayle: Escargot is the general French word for snail. The common snails that you find in English gardens are helix aspersa. They have been commonly eaten in parts of Somerset [at least] for centuries.7 Mar 2010
06/08/2021, 09:54 - James: Nice, you classy bitch
06/08/2021, 09:58 - Mike: Tastes like I bought crap quality meat and instead blasted it with garlic to hide the taste
06/08/2021, 09:58 - Mike: Did not feel fancy, 3/10 fuck France
06/08/2021, 09:59 - Mike: Got to use a scooper fork thing though, hence the 3

06/08/2021, 10:32 - Wezz: Felt the exact same with Oysters. Like drinking sea water with chilli and garlic. No wonder they tie in the aphrodisiac nonsense.
06/08/2021, 10:32 - Wezz: Sorry about your loss.
06/08/2021, 10:45 - Paul: What ever happened to that guy who got attacked Kirky?
06/08/2021, 10:46 - Lockers: That shit has betrayed me for the last time
06/08/2021, 10:49 - Paul: I feel like mustard is quite bold as a first choice condiment
06/08/2021, 10:49 - Paul: Plus there's so much mustard variety. You've told them nothing about you
06/08/2021, 10:50 - James: Maybe that's on purpose, keep his cards close to his chest
06/08/2021, 10:51 - Mike: Its a condiment eat condiment world at Nando's
06/08/2021, 10:52 - Lockers: That's not how condiments work, Mike
06/08/2021, 10:55 - Mike: Tell that to Mr Mayonnaise, only 3 days from retirement

06/08/2021, 11:26 - Lockers: One big misclick
06/08/2021, 11:26 - Paul: That's what your parents call you, right?
06/08/2021, 11:26 - James: Whoops, I accidentally clicked on my 6000 computers
06/08/2021, 11:26 - Lockers: That's "mistake"
06/08/2021, 11:26 - Lockers: Or regret

06/08/2021, 12:04 - Noone: It's not about appealing to your year 8 edginess, it's about communicating clearly
06/08/2021, 12:05 - Paul: You've lost your touch

06/08/2021, 13:51 - Paul: Are they going to look through Jacks entire erect penis catelogue and decide which ones are TOO feminine as well??? Slippery slope
06/08/2021, 14:03 - James: If Jack likes girls who look like little boys, how can it tell the difference?

07/08/2021, 09:00 - Lockers: No
07/08/2021, 09:06 - Dayle: Yo, thanks for a sick night last night lads xox
07/08/2021, 09:24 - Dayle: Drinking and being ill was not the one, I have woken up in pain üôÉ üò™ üôÇ
07/08/2021, 09:53 - Dayle: Anyone wanna play league?
07/08/2021, 10:06 - Kirky: <Media omitted>
07/08/2021, 10:41 - Wezz: Sucks you got shivers, hated that after my first jab. Impossible to sleep.
07/08/2021, 10:47 - Wezz: Yeah cheers for coming to Drew's banging birthday night gents. Thoroughly enjoyed drawing dicks and getting "Donnied" at Quake. I felt simultaneously old and immature, 10/10 ‚ú®
07/08/2021, 10:52 - Mike: <Media omitted>
07/08/2021, 10:53 - Lockers: Who won? And if it wasn't Mike who cheated?
07/08/2021, 10:54 - Mike: Captain Morgan won I can tell you at least that
07/08/2021, 10:55 - Wezz: James, he cheated
07/08/2021, 10:55 - Lockers: Story of your life
07/08/2021, 10:55 - Lockers: Knew it
07/08/2021, 11:04 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
07/08/2021, 11:05 - Wezz: I don't know anyone who's had it either
07/08/2021, 11:09 - Lockers: Fair enough, this is what I wanted. Cheers
07/08/2021, 11:12 - James: Standard cope by the boys here. Left them quaking in their boots
07/08/2021, 11:32 - Nathan: No brag (but it is) I had my 2nd Pfizer on Tuesday and felt fine after both, apart from a bit of a sore arm for a day or 2 I've felt great
07/08/2021, 11:32 - Nathan: Probably because your almost full German now I reckon
07/08/2021, 11:34 - Lockers: My issue was temperature regulation after the first one, excited for the second
07/08/2021, 12:00 - Kirky: GAMING?
07/08/2021, 12:00 - Kirky: I'm actually done. Boss let me go and everything no getting called back today

07/08/2021, 12:10 - Kirky: I mean not like yesterday when i finished early and got called back to do more work
07/08/2021, 12:12 - Dayle: piper is just getting some food then im down to play
07/08/2021, 12:12 - Kirky: Sweet
07/08/2021, 15:19 - Paul: Feeling way better now. At least it didn't seem to last very long.
07/08/2021, 15:20 - Paul: Happy Birthday Alex ü•≥ü•≥
07/08/2021, 15:29 - Mike: How old is he today? 12?
07/08/2021, 15:31 - Wezz: Happy Birthday @447597081425 ! üéÇü•≥üéÅüë∂üèª
07/08/2021, 15:32 - Qck: Many many many happy birthdays to you Alex!
07/08/2021, 15:41 - Paul: Is this just investing in the next few years in case you forget
07/08/2021, 15:50 - Derren: Happy birthday Alex!!
07/08/2021, 15:50 - Tapan: Happy Birthday Alex! üéÇüéÇüéÇ
07/08/2021, 15:52 - Qck: Makes me question why there are so many August fuckers here tbh
07/08/2021, 16:15 - Nathan: Parents had nothing else to do during the cold dark nights of winter üëÄ
07/08/2021, 16:50 - Paul: When's yours again? 8th?
07/08/2021, 16:55 - Qck: Wezz will let you know when the day arrives
07/08/2021, 16:58 - Paul: That's a lot of pressure on him.
07/08/2021, 17:05 - Mike: <Media omitted>
07/08/2021, 17:07 - Wezz: I got this
07/08/2021, 17:09 - Paul: Can we all just confirm that once again James failed to win when he didn't have his cheat hero
07/08/2021, 17:12 - Wezz: I had nightmares all last night of some dual shotgun-wielding stalker appearing from behind me.

Yeah, don't think he's won a game without playing that hero
07/08/2021, 17:26 - James: I came second without it because Paul went huge
07/08/2021, 17:26 - Dayle: JAMES WANNA COME AND CLASH?
07/08/2021, 17:27 - Paul: Jesus man say it louder next time I think there's someone at the back that didn't hear you

07/08/2021, 17:37 - Dayle: FUCKING FUCK
07/08/2021, 22:35 - Paul: How have I been on the internet as long as I have and I don't know who Chris Chan is?
07/08/2021, 22:36 - Mike: Same way I ignore anything twitch related
07/08/2021, 22:36 - Paul: But I didn't specifically ignore anything. I actually never came across it
07/08/2021, 22:45 - Kirky: chris chan so old
07/08/2021, 22:46 - Kirky: he did some sonic fanfics years ago
07/08/2021, 22:53 - Kirky: i bet you did and just didnt realise what you were looking at
07/08/2021, 22:54 - Paul: Probably
07/08/2021, 23:09 - Qck: I think you've been on the wrong internet this whole time
07/08/2021, 23:10 - Paul: That would explain a lot
08/08/2021, 00:35 - Lockers: Outernet
08/08/2021, 01:21 - James: Hey sorry I was out having some bevvies for Alex's birthday
08/08/2021, 01:22 - Kirky: fuck off

08/08/2021, 10:09 - Mike: weird photo to choose
08/08/2021, 10:12 - Nathan: Qck are you nocturnal?
08/08/2021, 11:12 - Wezz: He was streaming a couple hours before he died? No news on _how_ he died except "it was a big accident"?
08/08/2021, 11:18 - Noone: <Media omitted>

08/08/2021, 13:50 - Qck: Sleep is for the weak (ufc was on)
08/08/2021, 13:54 - Qck: You can imagine the neeks on reddit who were incensesed that they didn't know precisely how he died
08/08/2021, 15:06 - Qck: Incensesed?! Y'all not gonna tell me when I'm having a stroke?
08/08/2021, 15:07 - James: It's a Sunday afternoon, you deserve to be able to have a stroke without anyone judging you
08/08/2021, 15:17 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
08/08/2021, 16:19 - Paul: What's a simulated pregnancy
08/08/2021, 16:36 - Mike: The Sims video games
08/08/2021, 17:14 - Paul: That just leaves me with more questions
08/08/2021, 17:47 - Dayle: PSA: AAtroxx is a fucking prick
08/08/2021, 17:55 - Wezz: I looked it up.

Definition:
Symptom of an untreated psychiatric condition.

Weird.
08/08/2021, 17:55 - Paul: I also looked it up.

It says she has "network connectivity issues"
08/08/2021, 17:56 - Wezz: Always knew you were a pratt

08/08/2021, 18:34 - Paul: I would have predicted you'd have way weirder apps. It's disconcerting how normal this is
08/08/2021, 18:34 - Qck: why would i keep my weird apps on my home screen? that's how i lose my gf
08/08/2021, 18:35 - Paul: Same reason you get your knob out at any opportunity?
08/08/2021, 18:35 - Qck: oh the implication

08/08/2021, 22:37 - Wezz: Trying to get cannon out of tower range lool, but also didn't have armor runes.

08/08/2021, 22:38 - Kirky: Yea lol super close
08/08/2021, 23:27 - Wezz: https://youtu.be/sFBOQzSk14c?t=10

It's like they had a time machine. Need to rewatch this movie man.
09/08/2021, 09:14 - Mike: CEO of IKEA is the newly elected prime minister of Sweden, critiques are worried he won't be able to assemble his cabinet in time however.
09/08/2021, 09:15 - Dayle: ü•≥
09/08/2021, 09:16 - James: Very strong
09/08/2021, 09:20 - Paul: Do you know what I find annoying? This new trend of everyone thinking the polygraph machine is some complete pseudoscience. It's actually not. It's a pretty accurate tool. It's just not accurate enough to use as a definitive answer. Studies have found it to be between 80-95% accurate. That's better than most machine learning predictive diagnostic tools or real doctor diagnoses.
09/08/2021, 09:20 - James: Surprise surprise, the psychologist is defending pseudoscience
09/08/2021, 09:21 - Paul: It's just one of those reddit favourite tidbits that is just hilariously ironically shared misinformation
09/08/2021, 09:22 - Wezz: I remember you can tighten your sphincter on answering questions and it throws off the reading? Was ages ago I read that so maybe not true now.
09/08/2021, 09:23 - Paul: Haha yeah that was on QI
09/08/2021, 09:23 - James: Yeah, it's half shared information. It's true it's not a lie detector, which people then share as it's not entirely accurate, which people then share as it's not accurate at all. People like to disprove other people and show them they're wrong so it becomes a dick measuring contest where the truth takes a back seat
09/08/2021, 09:23 - Paul: This is exactly it and better articulated. Thanks James
09/08/2021, 09:24 - Wezz: Always knew it wasn't thetan level bs as it actually measured something. Measures the circumference of my ass
09/08/2021, 09:31 - Dayle: Who would be partial to a little Apex Legends?
09/08/2021, 10:06 - Noone: https://mkorostoff.github.io/1-pixel-wealth/
09/08/2021, 10:11 - Noone: wait, does't it jsut measure the electrical resistance in your hands?
09/08/2021, 10:12 - James: Crazy stuff man
09/08/2021, 10:12 - Noone: no wait, I was thinking of an Thetan level reader
09/08/2021, 10:15 - James: Polygraphs measure heart rate/blood pressure, respiration, and skin conductivity
09/08/2021, 10:15 - Noone: I thought you were caliming the E-meter that Scientologists use are somehow 80-95% accurate; got worried that Paul had gone off the deep end for real this time
09/08/2021, 10:16 - James: Polygraphs are okay, but if you want really reliable results, you need a professional tarot reader
09/08/2021, 10:21 - Mike: Spoken like a true Suppressive Person
09/08/2021, 10:24 - Mike: Let's get out of here James before he sucks the Thetans out of us
09/08/2021, 10:25 - James: Yeah, I've accumulated too many Thetans to have a little Thet-goblin suck them all up
09/08/2021, 10:28 - Qck: do any of you think you could do a free e-meter reading at a scientology centre and not get sucked into being a level 1 theta cuck?
09/08/2021, 10:28 - Qck: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_EeCkHs-e01
09/08/2021, 10:30 - Paul: Implying we aren't already members
09/08/2021, 10:32 - Qck: implying drew isn't the reincarnation of l ron hubbard
09/08/2021, 10:33 - Paul: This whole chat is a honey pot recruitment for you and Tapan
09/08/2021, 10:33 - Qck: what do you make of that, tapan?
09/08/2021, 10:35 - Paul: If you've ever watched a shot in chat it's too late you're compromised
09/08/2021, 10:38 - Lockers: And if you've done one?
09/08/2021, 10:38 - Paul: Don't pretend you're not part of this
09/08/2021, 10:40 - Lockers: I don't know what you're talking about, skipped through most of the chat
09/08/2021, 10:41 - Paul: Subtle
09/08/2021, 11:16 - Wezz: What's the best strategy to manage the insanely rich? (Other than eating them)

Do we just do nothing and expect them to become philanthropic in their weaker, elder years? Combined with some loathing of their struggle free children, they donate 90% away?

Maybe a letter from US military 'suggesting' they _make the right decision_ before something bad happens. If they refuse we get McAffee mark 2.
09/08/2021, 11:24 - Wezz: No lie, my lead nurse went to a tarot card reader on Saturday. She's a very smart researcher, was fascinated saying the reader was spot on with so much. I mentioned cold reading and she said "No this was freaky Sam, she knew things I didn't even hint at". Mentioned the subtleties but it seemingly upset her.

Asked her if she enjoyed it which she did. "I'm glad, that's all that matters" swiftly left.

AITA? Should I encourage her to HEART OF THE CARDS  yugiboii
09/08/2021, 11:25 - Wezz: First time I've written AITA, am the arsehole just for writing it
09/08/2021, 11:31 - Lockers: If you have to question it then you know the answer
09/08/2021, 11:43 - James: I think it's important for people to understand that what is being said is going to be a perspective on your life, it's a framework to consider things in a way that you might not normally think about it. You are entirely projecting your life onto the generic statements they are putting out, but sometimes the mental gymnastic you need to take to make it fit makes you think about things in a new light and put things in perspective.

I don't think anyone is going to pull exodia in tarot, but I also don't these things are necessarily a bad thing, as long as people remember that they are not magical, they are just cards with people who are good at reading people
09/08/2021, 11:54 - Mike: My mum went to a psychic who communicated with my dead brother, told her that was he was in a better place and not worry, all was well with him etc. Mum was religious so easily bought it, I thought it was a harmless lie and didn't think much of it.

Turns out she charged mum 50 quid and recommended weekly sessions to keep on contact, suddenly not so handless.
09/08/2021, 11:54 - Mike: Harmless*
09/08/2021, 11:55 - Mike: Nta, just trying to help someone gullible who probably doesn't want to be helped. Ignorance is bliss etc
09/08/2021, 11:55 - Mike: Might be better of trying to disprove God next time though, not these small time chumps
09/08/2021, 12:04 - Qck: I think if you believe in horoscopes and psychics and ghosts you should face the firing squad
09/08/2021, 12:05 - Mike: Or the French
09/08/2021, 12:05 - James: Yeah, that's then exploitable people in a bad place
09/08/2021, 12:06 - Qck: I think if you pretend you're psychic you should be studied on by scientists similar to how what those nasty japs did to the chinese in ww2
09/08/2021, 12:08 - Qck: And the killer whales too, they should get it
09/08/2021, 12:27 - Paul: I think a fair few psychics aren't charlatans but actually believe they have powers. Not sure which is worse
09/08/2021, 12:27 - Paul: I'm with Mike. It's perfectly fine until someone is making a profit off of you
09/08/2021, 12:28 - James: Delusional people at least don't mean the harm they're causing
09/08/2021, 12:28 - Paul: I'd actually love to go to a  good psychic and see what they can read off of me
09/08/2021, 12:29 - Paul: But I imagine a big part of it comes from being a believer kinda like some people being more susceptible to hypnosis
09/08/2021, 12:29 - James: "I am sensing... a great amount of hotness, from around your feet area. Do you suffer from hot feet"

"Not even slightly, this psychic thing is ridiculous"
09/08/2021, 12:29 - Mike: You remember my stoner friend Harold from uni? Works in London with his own hypnosis practice now, also teaches nights at the local uni
09/08/2021, 12:30 - Paul: A real psychic would spend 5 minutes reading Jack Noones mind before quitting their job
09/08/2021, 12:30 - Paul: Yeah I remember having a long conversation with him while drunk. I was pretty sceptical but he didn't take any offense.
09/08/2021, 12:30 - Mike: I imagine it's just the Hell March theme with nazi propaganda overlayed
09/08/2021, 12:31 - Paul: Nah it's just a gif loop of pepe the frog getting gangbanged by black men with Looney tunes music played through a nose flute

09/08/2021, 13:16 - Wezz: Was so funny seeing him again. He's so nice though, when he could tell I was skeptical, he hit me with the celebrity endorsements "y'know Tiger Woods has a _self hypnosis_ ritual before each shot, blinks, touches his ear..." interrupted with
"has an affair and crashes his car"

I was swiftly put in the not suitable for/compatible with hypnosis group. Wish he wasn't so bloody nice, got that 'tickle your balls' way with words.

Temperatures will reach 1.5C above 1850-1900 levels by 2040 under all emissions scenarios
The Arctic is likely to be practically ice-free in September at least once before 2050 in all scenarios assessed
There will be an increasing occurrence of some extreme events "unprecedented in the historical record" even at warming of 1.5C
Extreme sea level events that occurred once a century in the recent past are projected to occur at least annually at more than half of tidal gauge locations by 2100
There will be likely increases in fire weather in many regions

09/08/2021, 17:33 - Paul: what was the one you recommended last time about dice or something
09/08/2021, 17:34 - Wezz: That would have been Lee recommending Dice Man most likely.

09/08/2021, 17:40 - Wezz: You might also like *The Dice Man*:

The book tells the story... of a psychologist named Luke [Rhinehart] who, feeling bored and unfulfilled in life, starts making decisions... based on a roll of a die. Along the way, there is sex, rape, murder, 'dice parties', breakouts by psychiatric patients, and various corporate and governmental machines being put into a spin. There is also a description of the cult that starts to develop around the man, and the psychological research he initiates, such as the 'Fuck without Fear for Fun and Profit' programme

09/08/2021, 18:17 - James: Full disclosure, I clicked the link from a friend who plays professional rocket league, so it seemed legit he would want a vote for a league.

Anyone who clicked to log in through steam will need to change their password, in the few minutes it took to change mine they have spent my ~¬£60 in my steam wallet
09/08/2021, 18:17 - Wezz: hilarous if true

09/08/2021, 18:32 - James: Same, I was just watching something and did it in the background

09/08/2021, 18:34 - Wezz: It's loaded as an iframe to imitate a new window, disabled headers on it (so it's just a floating box). Then faked the chrome headers.

Easy way to tell, Chrome header doesn't carry my Chrome skin (black). They went with the default theme. They faked the old HTTPS "Valve Corp". Soon as you resize the window you can see it's dodge
09/08/2021, 18:35 - Qck: Lmao their flow chart on how to efficiently scam once the account is compromised is great

Most are copies from Steam with a couple bits added, first is his phishing login
09/08/2021, 18:50 - Wezz: The fake URL bar on the iframe looks good man, quite easy to fall for it tbh.
09/08/2021, 18:51 - Paul: Don't click these links wezz is hacked
09/08/2021, 18:51 - Wezz: All links are safe, just links to text

09/08/2021, 18:51 - Derren: Relax paul xD
09/08/2021, 18:51 - Derren: He's doing this shit in a sandbox anyway
09/08/2021, 18:52 - Derren: So many boomers in chat
09/08/2021, 18:52 - Derren: I'm famous, he was probably star struck
09/08/2021, 18:52 - Kirky: i think its a joke misto
09/08/2021, 18:52 - Derren: Well he also told wezz to "be careful"
09/08/2021, 18:52 - Wezz: Yeah, which was completely unneccessary. Literally a phishing attack with some fancy iframe/url bar display. No 0day madness going on here.
09/08/2021, 18:53 - Derren: <Media omitted>
09/08/2021, 18:53 - Kirky: oh lol
09/08/2021, 18:53 - Derren: Browsers are no fun without Java :D
09/08/2021, 18:53 - Lockers: What is 0day madness?
09/08/2021, 18:54 - James: A 0day is a vulnerability that has just been found, so everything is susceptible so it's chaos
09/08/2021, 18:55 - Lockers: You gonna do a quick scan of anything?
09/08/2021, 18:56 - James: I didn't download anything, I don't think it's needed
09/08/2021, 18:56 - Wezz: A zero-day (0day) vulnerability refers to a security vulnerability for which no mitigation or patch is available at the time it is disclosed or made public. Existing software patches are unable to properly defend against zero-day exploits, meaning attacks of this nature present a serious security risk to organizations.

They often sell for a tonne of money on the black market. Steam is a pretty huge target I'd imagine.
09/08/2021, 18:56 - James: It was a token grab for getting into my steam account
09/08/2021, 18:56 - Wezz: Yeah you don't need to scan anything
09/08/2021, 18:56 - Paul: I was joking
09/08/2021, 18:56 - Wezz: Just update password asap
09/08/2021, 18:56 - Lockers: Bro you've broken my trust once today
09/08/2021, 18:57 - James: Yeah, change password, reup your steam guard app if you want
09/08/2021, 18:57 - Wezz: they had one session active on your account. used it to extract ¬£¬£ and spread to your friends
09/08/2021, 18:57 - James: Everything else is damage control, check market history, readd freinds
09/08/2021, 18:58 - Derren: Doesn't Jack teach IT to kids?
09/08/2021, 18:58 - Wezz: their whole login process was fake, so they will have your steam password in plaintext and email
09/08/2021, 18:58 - Derren: üëÄ
09/08/2021, 18:58 - James: I work in software, it happens to us all dude
09/08/2021, 18:58 - Wezz: so sort your other accounts out if you're using the same password (which you shouldn't be), and enable 2FA everywhere (which you should already do for your main accounts)
09/08/2021, 18:58 - Derren: @447758520258 Do you use similar passwords for your email and other accounts?
09/08/2021, 18:58 - Lockers: Targeting the one who doesn't actually work in the industry
09/08/2021, 18:58 - Derren: I mean the questions he's asking xD
09/08/2021, 18:59 - Derren: If you do, time to start changing them
09/08/2021, 18:59 - Lockers: Nah it's actually a relief that this is a mega old password that isn't linked to the email account at all
09/08/2021, 18:59 - James: Yeah same, mine was a password insulting Paul from when he borrowed my account
09/08/2021, 18:59 - Lockers: Mine was from literally when i first set the account up
09/08/2021, 19:00 - Lockers: about 15 years ago
09/08/2021, 19:00 - Lockers: How much did you lose? I don't think he managed to get any inv and I had ¬£0 in steam wallet (no purchase history)
09/08/2021, 19:00 - Derren: That's what all the noobs say!
09/08/2021, 19:00 - James: I had just over ¬£60 in my steam wallet, and they drained it with CS cases, 90% to the same account
09/08/2021, 19:01 - James: I included the profile id in the support ticket I raised
09/08/2021, 19:01 - Wezz: I hope they'll refund you, did you include the site link in the ticket too?
09/08/2021, 19:02 - James: I didn't, you put it above right?
09/08/2021, 19:02 - Wezz: It's two links really:
09/08/2021, 19:03 - Wezz: Phishing link: https://authiemcup.com/
The server where lots of JS is stored: https://steamcommunity-a.akamaihd.net/
09/08/2021, 19:03 - James: I have the account back btw, so the friend requests are actually me
09/08/2021, 19:03 - Lockers: +1
09/08/2021, 19:03 - Wezz: If you include in the ticket they'll ban sitewide atleast
09/08/2021, 19:05 - Lockers: Well that was a fun bit of drama wasn't it
09/08/2021, 19:06 - James: That's the last time I'm ever nice to old friends

09/08/2021, 19:07 - James: This is how paranoia starts, I try and delete the URL bar on every website I visit in the future
09/08/2021, 19:09 - Lockers: you're loving this aren't you
09/08/2021, 19:11 - Wezz: I just find it fascinating man.. sorry. I'm sure Valve will sort out the money spent, it was all spanked within like 10 minutes on some rando account that they'll also ban and track.
09/08/2021, 19:11 - Lockers: Oh I wasn't having a go! haha
09/08/2021, 19:11 - Lockers: You cunt
09/08/2021, 19:11 - Paul: Why didn't 2FA save them though? Didn't Gabe give out his password publically?
09/08/2021, 19:11 - Wezz: They logged in 2FA on the website
09/08/2021, 19:12 - James: It spoofs the entire log in process, so it looks legit while you're going through it
09/08/2021, 19:12 - Wezz: website was actually spoofing to be valve, and works as a man in the middle. Logging in itself to Steam in the background using the information you provided
09/08/2021, 19:13 - James: Exactly, so when it asked on steam for a steam guard prompt, my phone gave me one, as it was asked for one, just by them at the same time
09/08/2021, 19:13 - Wezz: obv has to happen pretty close to realtime for the 2FA to work. So so rare for a phishing site to spoof 2FA this well, takes a lot of work.
09/08/2021, 19:13 - Wezz: Cause you mimick all the steam errors through your phishing site back to the user. Most of the code is them doing that
09/08/2021, 19:15 - Lockers: There was no delay and wasn't anything obvious to give it away, just seemed like the hundreds of other times I've done it at a glanc
09/08/2021, 19:15 - Lockers: e
09/08/2021, 19:15 - James: Yeah, same here, nothing was out of the ordinary compared to any other time I'd done it, as normally there is something obvious to ring alarm bells
09/08/2021, 19:18 - Paul: Damn, that's crazy...
09/08/2021, 19:19 - Wezz: Yup, it's a well-done phishing site. Just gotta be very careful when entering 2FA anywhere new, always try going directly to the site (steam) and logging in there, most shared auth utilises open sessions (afaik), rather than making you actually 2FA.

I mean, that's gonna spread far.
09/08/2021, 19:21 - Wezz: you might get some credit for reporting it asap. the dev did some funky work with randomly generated login pages too, i can only assume it provides analytics on which link was clicked on (each login generates new GET var which tracks through link)

e.g. https://authiemcup.com/g2aL2irZ3g/e0p3zxt9qv/7ntzuqlxve?q=g2aL2irZ3g&s=b853b02365e0b2d2a3d830f8c4aa9ff8
09/08/2021, 19:21 - Paul: surprised there isnt a discussion going around about it
09/08/2021, 19:21 - Lockers: put it on reddit gogogo
09/08/2021, 19:22 - Paul: the real question is wezz, can you steal their admin privileges and post a provocative headline about cadred?
09/08/2021, 19:22 - Lee: lol funniest thing about this is the 'wanna clash'
Literally the only words Kirky ever says to me ü•≤

09/08/2021, 19:24 - Lee: I legit got groomed though. For like a year.
09/08/2021, 19:25 - Lee: Or the guy decided our online friendship wasn't worth anything anymore.
09/08/2021, 19:25 - Lee: Not sure which.
09/08/2021, 19:25 - Wezz: But if you search for the JS site (steamcommunity-a.akamaihd.net) you'll find a load of posts describing similar attacks. akamaihd.net's been around since 2009 and is clearly some guys server for scriptkiddie-ing.

09/08/2021, 19:48 - Lee: The best part about it was waiting for James to join the chat with an explanation.
09/08/2021, 19:50 - Dayle: <Media omitted>
09/08/2021, 19:51 - Wezz: Yeah Lockers explanation wasn't worth waiting for
"Uhhh guys, guys, I dint do anyfing and now skins not there. Gone kick ball abaut and do ma Norton scans"
09/08/2021, 19:51 - Lockers: Dude, I didn't deserve that :(
09/08/2021, 19:52 - Lockers: Regret wishing you a happy birthday now
09/08/2021, 19:52 - Dayle: WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIT didnt lockers have a Iby power hollo on his basic m4?
09/08/2021, 19:52 - James: I was fighting with Steams over complicated password reset system, and thought "Oh for christ's sake, now they're all waiting for me"
09/08/2021, 19:53 - Lockers: I didn't notice it telling you that you have to remove 2fa to change password during the whole process though? That got me worried
09/08/2021, 19:53 - Lockers: like I just asked to remove password and it was like "oh you want to remove mobile guard?" or whatever its called
09/08/2021, 19:54 - Piper: and it was drew
09/08/2021, 19:54 - Piper: all a long
09/08/2021, 19:54 - Wezz: Poor James, smart man and IT professional had to lump that he 2FA'd into some dodgy site on the trust garnered from his rocket league friend. That's one degree separations from football James.
09/08/2021, 19:54 - James: Like I said, never trusting anyone again
09/08/2021, 19:55 - Paul: yeah it still exists

09/08/2021, 20:47 - James: Steam has no incentive to stop these scams, as nobody lost their account, they can deny all knowledge, and valve profits from all the extra market sales as they take a cut

09/08/2021, 22:28 - James: No, they made loads of 16p purchases, and it didn't need 2FA for small purchases
09/08/2021, 22:29 - Lockers: Ahh interesting. Strange that he must spend so much time conversing with people on the friends lists
09/08/2021, 22:29 - James: I know, it's only fuelling my conspiracy flames
09/08/2021, 22:29 - James: It's probably all automated

09/08/2021, 22:34 - James: Though after 'compormise' he might know me better than I do
09/08/2021, 22:34 - Lockers: Didn't even notice üòÇ skim reading and assumed typo

09/08/2021, 22:35 - Mike: cant believe you thought James won a cs competition, have you met James?
09/08/2021, 22:36 - Lockers: That's why I thought it was a competition type thing, like a raffle. Didn't really read it
09/08/2021, 22:38 - James: I found a new character in CS and now I win every game
09/08/2021, 22:39 - Lockers: Did you download it from that same link too?
09/08/2021, 22:51 - Wezz: Yeah seems automated for the first barrage to all friends (vote + the urgent), then manual follow-ups. A guy is live on the Steam acc. Just been reading about monetising of Steam accounts and it's bloody hard. Valve put a tonne of work into preventing it, things like 14 day no trades to new accounts, newly authorised device = no trading for 7 days, password reset = no trading, recently added 2fa, recently removed 2fa, have to have purchased something between 7 - 365 days ago, essentially tonnes of market restrictions.

However if 2FA is enabled, most of these are bypassed (e.g. new device 7-day market ban).

Which then enables them to cash out through various shady means, e.g. skin trading or selling, skin gambling, skins for crypto. I imagine in most (legitimate) cases Valve just reimburse their imaginary money and rollback skins on the hit account. The amount of bot accounts used for the 3rd party skin trading/gambling is obscene. On the website you click the skin you want to trade, a random bot friend adds you on steam, you accept and it trade requests you, you send it for free. Then another bot adds you to give you the traders item. A sort of 'Escrow' system. All automated.
09/08/2021, 22:53 - James: I raised a support ticket and they said their process is now no refunds at all through the market. I'll take a bit of a hit, but all I can do is hope to get some of it back from selling the cases again in a couple of weeks once I'm market enabled again
09/08/2021, 22:53 - James: I imagine it will be a trickle though
09/08/2021, 22:55 - Wezz: So they spent the whole ¬£60 on crates? Nothing left your account?
09/08/2021, 22:56 - Lockers: This surely suggests that scammers were taking advantage of the refund scheme too?
09/08/2021, 22:57 - James: Yeah, it was all the same crate, 90% from the same person, so I reported that account as probably involved in some way
09/08/2021, 22:59 - James: Almost definitely, it's the only way to get money out of the account without the auth app, and I can't get it back or reverse the charges
09/08/2021, 23:07 - Wezz: I believe they also have price listing restrictions on items, e.g. 20% above or below the average market price. Did you check what the crates are going for?

Bastards if they don't refund - go hard, esp if the purchases are all the most expensive listings of the item. Literally makes no sense for a user to buy that many from one user at a higher price except for transferring money between accounts. I'm onboard the Valve‚Ñ¢ commission fee conspiracy if they don't.
09/08/2021, 23:08 - James: So you can't choose which ones you buy with crates, they're commodities so you put in buy orders
09/08/2021, 23:08 - James: You say the max you'd buy for, and it buys that amount from the cheapest up
09/08/2021, 23:09 - James: But the ticket was closed within the hour with me arguing why I couldn't get the purchases reversed, and they flat out said they wouldn't do anything about it
09/08/2021, 23:10 - Wezz: Hmm, you think the guy was trying to trade them after purchase then?
09/08/2021, 23:11 - Wezz: Unless he's part of some huge case farm... which I imagine is unlikely.
09/08/2021, 23:11 - James: Probably listed a bunch at that price from another account, they'd be no benefit otherwise, I don't think you can trade things you just bought
09/08/2021, 23:12 - James: Like I said, most of them was to a single account which would be a weird coincidence that they happened to be selling 400 of the same crate that day
09/08/2021, 23:19 - Wezz: So weird. So they either:
1. Have a huge consolidated inventory that they list from when they get an account with ¬£¬£. Somehow it evades being banned despite being involved in multiple instances of fraud.
2. Or do they buy out a low-cost commodity and list up at a slightly higher cost to make a margin on the original account? You mentioned there's a delay between buying->selling.

Just don't see an operation of no.1's size actually evading suspension. Missing something I think.
09/08/2021, 23:20 - Lockers: Wonder how much is to be made
09/08/2021, 23:26 - James: I guess the issue comes when you need to prove its involved, you can't ban people for selling on the market place in bulk

11/08/2021, 09:15 - Noone: has the term "glowies" made it into the mainstream yet?
11/08/2021, 09:21 - Mike: Is it in anywhere? Thought I just made it up

11/08/2021, 12:17 - Paul: TIL that there's a system that can focus giant telescopes from all over the planet to make a mega telescope
11/08/2021, 12:17 - Paul: VLBI works by creating an array of smaller telescopes that can be synchronized to focus on the same object at the same time and act as a giant virtual telescope. In some cases, the smaller telescopes are also an array of multiple telescopes. This technique has been used to track spacecraft and to image distant cosmic radio sources, such as quasars
11/08/2021, 12:18 - Kirky: Still couldn't see your dick

11/08/2021, 22:01 - Wezz: Was spotted today by Lee and I at Cambridge Circus in London. Lee knows him as Prism Man. Used to come into Virgin Megastore and stand around. Nice to see him still ticking
11/08/2021, 22:02 - Wezz: Not sure I'll sleep well tonight unless I know what you had for tea. Pics please ‚ù§Ô∏è

11/08/2021, 22:31 - Wezz: D'you think he wears it to bed?
11/08/2021, 22:31 - Wezz: Surely he's most vulnerable when he's sleeping
11/08/2021, 22:33 - Lee: I asked him once. He said he takes it off at home. Because he constructed a giant one that fits over his whole house.
11/08/2021, 22:35 - Paul: I had penne arrabiata and Julia had spaghetti aglio e olio and copious white whine between us
11/08/2021, 22:35 - Paul: No pics sorry

12/08/2021, 12:45 - James: You're definitely a charisma character
12/08/2021, 12:46 - Alex: Before uni when you had a bag that weighed 4tonnes due to your alienware laptop, maybe you've always been insufferable?!
12/08/2021, 12:46 - Alex: Nah, weve all seen rorth stand like a sack of potatoes

12/08/2021, 14:58 - Derren: Haven't been practising :(
12/08/2021, 14:58 - Wezz: Literally no idea how you all can watch anime. I've tried and it's just formulaic incel shit. 200 eps for a mediocre story arc
12/08/2021, 14:59 - Wezz: Sexualised cartoons about being _stronger_ than other people. Ape brain content
12/08/2021, 15:00 - Wezz: Oh my god, he's so strong. Cue training montage. Now I'M STRONGER. Female swoon. Incels unite we'll never talk to women but live vicariously through our introverted protagonist
12/08/2021, 15:04 - Dayle: <Media omitted>
12/08/2021, 15:08 - James: Someone's jealous they don't have anime power

12/08/2021, 18:12 - Wezz: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oejcmbLX_1U

Probably going to hell for this, but Amazon union chances looking bleak after seeing employees intelligence displayed in this vid. Regardless of the multi-million ¬£ lawyers that they're up against. Some of the first to be replaced by robots.
12/08/2021, 18:16 - Wezz: Okay, spoke a little soon. Respect to the guy at 5:52 and Gucci mask lady.
12/08/2021, 18:21 - Dayle: what is that thing at the begining
12/08/2021, 18:23 - Wezz: Also, fuck me. Respect to all of them. But w/e you get the point. The day you're getting written up for protesting is straight up bullshit.
12/08/2021, 18:26 - Mike: Pretty rag tag but these are Amazon workers, not marketing or PR experts. They won't get any viewers with 10 minutes rant video but maybe its the start of something
12/08/2021, 18:27 - Mike: need to find a little white girl whos parents died in the amazon factory
12/08/2021, 18:27 - Wezz: I mean, if someone competent brings the facts together and shares them on an international scale they will make millions in book sales and interviews.
12/08/2021, 18:27 - Mike: crop Bezos spitting onto their corpses as his management staff pick the clothes off the body and had it to the the next drone
12/08/2021, 18:28 - Kirky: Kill a little white girls parents in an Amazon factory * just to get it moving quicker
12/08/2021, 18:28 - Mike: Kirky gets it, woe betide Royal Mail if he starts protesting
12/08/2021, 18:28 - Kirky: You think that was my MANAGERS gun?
12/08/2021, 18:29 - Kirky: I'll was about to start a revolution dammit
12/08/2021, 18:29 - Wezz: Nah, black fits the current narratives well, black lady lost her sister in the vid to COVID. Just need someone coherent to hit us with the facts + bring her in (minus the Gucci mask) to bring the emotional side.
12/08/2021, 18:30 - Wezz: Pow, media appearances everywhere. Except my media firm because we take bribes and use AWS.

12/08/2021, 20:10 - Lockers: Fancied something different
12/08/2021, 20:10 - Lockers: In all seriousness, its had me in bed all day today. Terrible initial reaction too yesterday when I had it
12/08/2021, 20:11 - Paul: And you called me soft
12/08/2021, 20:11 - Wezz: What happened yesterday? Within 30 min of your jab?
12/08/2021, 20:11 - Mike: Just your DNA being rewritten into spaghettios, nothing to worry about
12/08/2021, 20:12 - Paul: Yeah you're meant to wait to check for initial side effects I thought
12/08/2021, 20:14 - Lockers: Had to go lay down on a bed out back in boots because I nearly passed out then layed there in a pool of sweat for about 45 mins
12/08/2021, 20:15 - Paul: Were you nervous? That happened to me at school once after a jab. Had a massive blood pressure drop

12/08/2021, 20:19 - Paul: Retard
12/08/2021, 20:21 - Lockers: Was fine by 2.30pm
12/08/2021, 20:21 - Lockers: Wondering if having Covid before might be a reason?
12/08/2021, 20:21 - Wezz: Yeah, Dr Mike is right, Heinz Double Helix initiated. You'll be fine after tonight, just a big craving for things in tomato sauce.
12/08/2021, 20:26 - Wezz: Could be, i think nature published something on people only having one mRNA if you've had COVID before because the second shots (for patients who had covid pre jabs) had higher adverse events
12/08/2021, 20:26 - Wezz: Wasn't Nature, was BMJ:

16/08/2021, 11:23 - Mike: Think it's something like 0.3% of people in US identify as non binary, seems like they're overrepresented in tech along with men
16/08/2021, 11:26 - Wezz: Men need to start identifying as women to solve their over representation in IT. Come on girls, solidarity.
16/08/2021, 11:28 - Mike: Baby for a pay check I'll be whoever you want me to
16/08/2021, 11:28 - Mike: Cheque*
16/08/2021, 11:28 - Wezz: Considerable 'work to do'. Please show me the slide where they outline the 'work'.
16/08/2021, 11:30 - Wezz: The work is, employ someone like Green Park to write a diversity report, highlighting our company understands we have 'work to do'. Maybe do a few D&I classes. Pat ourselves on the back and move on
16/08/2021, 11:31 - Wezz: Or, favour underrepresented groups in employment. Thus undermining a meritocracy and those who fill those positions.

Imagine being unsure whether you're employed for your abilities rather than your sexuality. Great 'work' üòÇ
16/08/2021, 11:51 - Paul: What would you suggest?
16/08/2021, 11:53 - Paul: not implying i agree with them, but just curious if its their unproductive approach that you're criticising or the whole concept
16/08/2021, 11:53 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
16/08/2021, 11:59 - Paul: This is a very weak argument that will convince few people. Stalin absolutely was left wing economically, its just that his social policies and the war got in the way and redirected Russian production towards armament and profiteering which abandoned the dictum of Lenin towards a far more authoritarian dogma, hence why they separated from Trotskyism. I don't understand why any socialist would support Stalin, but I also don't think it's productive to pretend he was right wing
16/08/2021, 12:02 - Paul: this sort of revisionism only hurts long term imo
16/08/2021, 12:03 - Wezz: It's definitely helpful reflecting on representation and in some situations I'd agree it's a good employment criteria to prioritise. E.g. Jury Service, Public Councils, PPIE. Generally when your aim is to represent the community you're serving.

But to do so in competitive recruitment, in which you're looking at competence as your primary employment criteria, it's crazy.
16/08/2021, 12:03 - Wezz: Gotta go lunch but will actually answer when I'm back üòÇ
16/08/2021, 12:03 - Paul: yeah, its basically affirmative action in a different disguise
16/08/2021, 12:03 - Wezz: Totally agree
16/08/2021, 12:04 - Paul: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_Opposition
16/08/2021, 12:05 - Paul: worth reading though, its not that clear
16/08/2021, 12:07 - Wezz: Essentially, all my actions would be around equalising opportunity to resources around education and employment. It's lame and will 'never be enough' to address the current observed disparities. But it's the fair approach.
16/08/2021, 12:07 - Wezz: LUNCH TIME READING BABY
16/08/2021, 12:08 - Paul: its unfortunately the sort of thing that you'll need quite a lot of prior reading to really get, they dont do a very good job of putting it in simple laymen terms imo
16/08/2021, 12:08 - Paul: but worth a try nonetheless
16/08/2021, 12:09 - Paul: Depends on what you mean by "fair" and who you mean fair to I guess.
16/08/2021, 12:16 - Derren: There will never be equality of outcome in the world
16/08/2021, 12:16 - Derren: Unless you force certain groups into doing certain things
16/08/2021, 12:17 - Paul: Yeah welcome to utilitarian soviet era mindsets
16/08/2021, 12:17 - Paul: Luckily I think most people have moved past that mindset into thinking more productively
16/08/2021, 12:22 - Nathan: Anyone done any studies on the representation of straight men in the fashion industry? Are there too few straight men who are employed within this sector? Do we need to do research and positively recruit straight men?

That would be absurd. If the rates of women in IT are low maybe its just that they don't want a job in tech with a bunch of nerds... I hate positive recruitment. Is person x better equipped to complete what is required for the job better than person y? Then person x gets the job. Education has to be the only way that changes can happen
16/08/2021, 12:24 - Paul: Yeah it's like fire-departments lowering their fitness standards to recruit more women
16/08/2021, 12:29 - Mike: Look what it did to socialism in America, people still think the Nazis were the socialist party
16/08/2021, 12:32 - Mike: Nursing, fashion, teaching, we must take these back for oppressed men
16/08/2021, 12:34 - Nathan: Straight men assemble and we shall grab our torch and pitchforks and riot! Never had these issues before women got the vote! üò©
16/08/2021, 12:38 - Derren: Well they would say you have highlighted the problem here, IT / Tech is depicted in the media etc as being a place for nerdy guys which can "scare" away potential females that are interested in the field
16/08/2021, 12:39 - Mike: Women don't want to be in tech because you never see women in tech
16/08/2021, 12:40 - Mike: No one is willing to point out that the penis is just better designed for dealing with programming and tech
16/08/2021, 12:40 - Derren: <Media omitted>
16/08/2021, 12:41 - Mike: I know I've written good code when my penis reaches fully erect, how would a woman know the same????
16/08/2021, 12:47 - Kirky: i heard on crunch days you can even utlise it to type on an extra keyboard between your legs
16/08/2021, 13:17 - Wezz: And this is where the virtuosity blinds the logic. Because defining 'fair' is not only addressing representation in each institution. But across all organisational positions (e.g. CEOs, upper management, cleaners).

Ignoring the fact that it's a huge oversimplification saying one thing (prejudice) is a sufficient explanation for a huge range of education/social/occupational variables.

It's also impossible to implement in an equitable manner. Most people have multiple group identities, each with their own historical combo of oppression (or privilege). Maybe you put someone in charge of sorting that out? Will leave us with more problems than we started with.

There are definitely prejudices at play, when identified they need to be punished hard. We're seeing this happen more often and it's a pivotal step in weeding out the previous generations. It's healthy to constantly review and ask ourselves if we can do anything extra, but also we have to be realistic that old people are stupid and racist and will die soon. Thanks.
16/08/2021, 13:20 - Paul: Well you said it was the "fair approach", so I just thought it was interesting to clarify by which moral standard this approach considers itself fair. I never made a claim either way
16/08/2021, 13:21 - Paul: It's certainly utilitarian and effective long term, by that metric I agree, but fairness is very relative
16/08/2021, 13:22 - Paul: I'm not even arguing that I think fairness is above all other aspects the most important, as I certainly would love to burn and eat the rich
16/08/2021, 13:35 - Wezz: I did think about this quite a bit. Personally, I don't want any credit for things I can't control, e.g. race/gender whatever. They're literally the most boring things about me.

Fixating on them really takes away from a lot of the shared progress made - however, I'm also aware I'm one of the bigger benefactors (white/male) so fuck me in the ass and eat my cereal.
16/08/2021, 13:37 - Mike: Can I have your credit?
16/08/2021, 13:40 - Wezz: I just want to keep it for _a bit longer_...
16/08/2021, 13:44 - Kirky: im literally only friends with you because youre a white male though
16/08/2021, 13:44 - Wezz: Shit... I'm only friends with you because of your disability.
16/08/2021, 13:57 - Wezz: Exactly Nathan, you see, all those straight men aren't making the 'right' choices. We need to apply substantive force to ensure they take up a career in fashion. Anything less is inequitable and will be addressed accordingly.
16/08/2021, 14:04 - Wezz: <Media omitted>

Nandos made BBC news this morning. 50 restaurants closed due to shortage of peri peri chicken. Should have stepped in yesterday @447943624891
18/08/2021, 09:12 - Dayle: I really enjoy these
18/08/2021, 09:13 - Mike: Turns out I can still get salads or the imitators for lunch, fuck the chicken
18/08/2021, 09:18 - Lockers: Mike's advice of the day : Fuck the chicken
18/08/2021, 09:30 - Wezz: Not quite the damage control the public are looking for Mike.
18/08/2021, 09:31 - James: You think we're still talking to Mike? His phone has been taken over by corporate, they're trying to spread the message that people don't even want chicken from Nando's, so what's the problem
18/08/2021, 09:33 - Wezz: Is this artificial peri peri market scarcity?
Are Nandos manipulating the chicken market?

18/08/2021, 09:50 - Mike: Bunch of nandos restaurant staff have been seconded to supply warehouses to cut chicken
18/08/2021, 09:50 - Mike: Staffing issue along the supply lines apparently
18/08/2021, 09:51 - Dayle: What 35p energy chicken shop you running here mike
18/08/2021, 09:51 - James: I can't imagine how horrified some of the front of house staff who are used to being quick, pretty, and smiling; now stuffed in a dark warehouse cutting chicken to loud, Vietnamese tannoy messages
18/08/2021, 09:52 - James: "chicky mao, CHICKY MAO"
18/08/2021, 09:52 - Dayle: ü§£ü•≤
18/08/2021, 09:53 - Mike: Well I'm glad you asked Dayle, due to Nando's ongoing commitment to being carbon neutral we are more susceptible to supply line issues. Our competitors have an advantage here but we believe that saving the planet comes first, even to our delicious peri-peri üêî. Now with Garlic BBQ sauce!
18/08/2021, 09:53 - Noone: LOL

18/08/2021, 10:06 - James: No, it's a UK website unfortunately
18/08/2021, 10:06 - Dayle: Yeah that looks like poor UX design, I understand if you ulternate a OK, cancel when its an important form but thata fucked..
18/08/2021, 10:06 - Derren: It's making sure you're paying attention James
18/08/2021, 10:06 - Derren: So you don't give your login away again

18/08/2021, 10:18 - Derren: <Media omitted>
18/08/2021, 10:18 - James: Planning to sell next week to recoup some funds, my account was market locked because of the password change/update to 2FA
18/08/2021, 10:19 - Wezz: Looking forward to getting some cheap crates, thanks mate
18/08/2021, 11:20 - James: Oh damn, just seen the news that Sean Lock has passed away age 58
18/08/2021, 11:21 - Dayle: Oh üëé
18/08/2021, 11:21 - Dayle: That really sucks
18/08/2021, 11:50 - Lee: No way. Didn't know he had cancer.
18/08/2021, 12:05 - Noone: Honestly the worst news all year
18/08/2021, 12:10 - Wezz: Oh whaaat. That's awful. I never knew
18/08/2021, 15:15 - Kirky: i think we should all watch this together in tribute https://youtu.be/0UGuPvrsG3E
18/08/2021, 15:21 - Paul: wait WTF Sean Lock died?
18/08/2021, 16:59 - Qck: That sucks, 15 storeys high is really good if anyone hasn't seen it before
18/08/2021, 17:29 - Dayle: Yo, some one tell me or break down wtf is going on in afghan, we going back to don them up?
18/08/2021, 17:30 - Dayle: nvm googled it
18/08/2021, 17:39 - Mike: Think we and the rest of the west just admitted defeat and got donnied mate, not spoiling for round 2
18/08/2021, 17:40 - Dayle: ahh thanks for the detailed break down i do get it now thanks :D
18/08/2021, 17:41 - Mike: turns out it costs more than 2.2trillion to build a country and its people from the ground up within 20 years
18/08/2021, 17:49 - Mike: <Media omitted>
18/08/2021, 17:50 - Mike: also I love lamps
18/08/2021, 17:54 - James: <Media omitted>
18/08/2021, 17:55 - Wezz: The West (after draining lots of oil) 'trained' and 'armed' (very loose definitions) a government that got immediately overthrown by Taliban donnies. Now the Taliban donnies are rocking about in bumper cars and generally donning it up with all the west goodies. We have the oil though so it's okay.
18/08/2021, 17:55 - Mike: Jaffa cake gin??
18/08/2021, 17:55 - James: Yeah, I bought it for Kayleigh as a gift, it smells like jaffa cakes, but I don't like gin, so can't comment on the taste
18/08/2021, 17:58 - Wezz: If it happened while Trump was the big donnie it'd be considered some 35p energy drink exercise. But since old donnie is in charge we're mostly empathetic about the whole thing.
18/08/2021, 18:07 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
18/08/2021, 18:07 - Paul: Weren't all the Taliban deals made by trump though?

18/08/2021, 18:09 - Wezz: Yeah, you'd like that wouldn't you
18/08/2021, 18:10 - Paul: Pretty sure it was back in Feb
18/08/2021, 18:10 - Wezz: Thought I saw you there
18/08/2021, 18:10 - Paul: 2020

18/08/2021, 20:05 - Dayle: <Media omitted>
18/08/2021, 20:06 - Lockers: Is the 509% compared to what you normally do?
18/08/2021, 20:06 - Mike: what am i looking at here
18/08/2021, 20:06 - Dayle: Its 300 cals burn as a target goal the % is variable based on goal. Been gym twice today absolutely fucked
18/08/2021, 20:07 - Dayle: Same again tomorrow
18/08/2021, 20:08 - Dayle: Pink daily cals burnt today but activity alone, green logged exercise, blue active hours for the day
18/08/2021, 20:11 - Lockers: Fair
18/08/2021, 20:11 - Lockers: I need to get myself a watch that tracks this
18/08/2021, 20:27 - Derren: Depends man, there's so much stuff out there about shampoo and conditioner
18/08/2021, 20:28 - Derren: This one doesn't have silicone, when I started using non silicone my hair felt a bit straw like but feels fine after a while
18/08/2021, 20:28 - Derren: Also before covid I washed my hair everyday, now I only do it every 3 to 4 days
18/08/2021, 20:32 - Wezz: Pics tomorrow or it didn't happen
18/08/2021, 20:33 - Kirky: do you have to input everything manually?
18/08/2021, 20:36 - Paul: I just lost the game
18/08/2021, 20:36 - Wezz: Ah I always hear how bad it is to wash every day. Just can't do it though, feel dirty.
18/08/2021, 20:36 - Dayle: no its all fancy
18/08/2021, 20:37 - Kirky: can you reset it and jerk off?
18/08/2021, 20:37 - Kirky: just so we can see
18/08/2021, 20:37 - Paul: Also a vid
18/08/2021, 20:40 - James: I think it depends on hair type, my hair is curly so is pretty dry naturally, so I wash about once every other day, and use only conditioner for 3/4 times
18/08/2021, 21:05 - Derren: As I said when I was leaving the house I felt the same but as I don't go anywhere I don't mind washing it every 3 to 4 days
18/08/2021, 21:13 - Wezz: So you condition it every day? And wash every other day?
18/08/2021, 21:14 - Derren: I think he means he conditions his hair every 3 to 4 washes
18/08/2021, 21:14 - Derren: Which is kinda weird üòÇ
18/08/2021, 21:16 - Wezz: Yeah, I'd defo shower once every couple days if I worked from home - just wash it then. But going to work daily means shower every morning üòë
18/08/2021, 21:26 - Derren: Hey bro I didn't say I don't wash my body
18/08/2021, 21:26 - Derren: üòÇ
18/08/2021, 21:27 - Derren: You can shower without washing your hair
18/08/2021, 21:31 - Paul: Did the thanet lads know the winter gardens is closing?
18/08/2021, 21:33 - Dayle: good fucking shithole
18/08/2021, 21:33 - Dayle: eye sore on the cliftonville area
18/08/2021, 21:34 - Paul: Only because it hasn't been renovated for like 90 years lol. It's actually a really nice architecture
18/08/2021, 21:36 - Dayle: I was joking, yeah sad times had a mascorade ball there was nice
18/08/2021, 21:40 - Paul: Theatre royale too

18/08/2021, 22:02 - James: No, wash it every other day with double conditioner, then every 3-4 washes will shampoo and conditioner instead
18/08/2021, 22:03 - James: The opposite dude, condition everytime
18/08/2021, 22:04 - Derren: Ah I thought it was a bit weird üòÇ
18/08/2021, 22:04 - Paul: That's way too much conditioner
18/08/2021, 22:06 - Mike: I use shower gel on my balls and my head, don't be like me kids
18/08/2021, 22:07 - James: Different hair types dude, remember how you used to complain it wasn't fair my hair never got greasy?
18/08/2021, 22:11 - James: My hair does the opposite where if I shampoo too much it dries into oblivion
18/08/2021, 22:12 - Paul: No
18/08/2021, 23:16 - Noone: We need to go back

19/08/2021, 18:31 - Derren: Ran over people on a main street with rental van

20/08/2021, 08:30 - Paul: Did you guys know that James wears special arm lengtheners? His arms aren't really that long. It's why he always wears long sleeves
20/08/2021, 08:37 - James: Mike already knows my arms aren't very long, it's been a point of contention
20/08/2021, 08:46 - Mike: The research has been done I can confirm
20/08/2021, 09:15 - Paul: Christ so imagine him without the arm lengtheners

20/08/2021, 11:03 - James: They said that they will still allow sex workers as long as they adhere to their content guidelines. Really weird though, talk about cutting off most of your revenue.
20/08/2021, 11:03 - Paul: Didn't tumblr lose like half their revenue when they banned porn
20/08/2021, 11:04 - James: Yeah, I don't know why the world insists on pretending people aren't all horny bastards that like to see naked people
20/08/2021, 11:05 - Paul: I wonder if it's related to the company being English and the UK porn distribution ban
20/08/2021, 11:05 - James: Ultimately this is a control thing right? Onlyfans provides a way for women to monetise their sexuality and bodies without any middle men
20/08/2021, 11:06 - James: It's a image thing, looks like they're preparing to sell/get investments
20/08/2021, 11:06 - Wezz: Was chatting about it last night. Pretty sure there was a court case with youporn that caused them to delete most of their Amateur section. It was to do with age verification of people in the vids. They got held accountable for hosting child porn and footage without consent. Now other sites are following suit.

Would guess OF has ID verification though ü§î
20/08/2021, 11:06 - Paul: BBC says it's about under 18s and beastiality
20/08/2021, 11:07 - Paul: Wasn't this pornhub
20/08/2021, 11:08 - Wezz: Yeah probably...literally skim read it. Principle's the same
20/08/2021, 11:08 - James: I'm pretty sure there was already strict content regulations on Onlyfans against things implying violence, including anything involving weapons or fake blood.
20/08/2021, 11:08 - Paul: Yeah like you didn't notice like the rest of us...
20/08/2021, 11:09 - Paul: "BBC has seen examples of some of the banned content. In one video a man is seen eating faeces"
20/08/2021, 11:09 - Paul: Why is that illegal I don't get it
20/08/2021, 11:09 - James: It's their delicate conservative mindsets Paul, we don't want to upset them
20/08/2021, 11:09 - Mike: Because people might learn that poo actually tastes great, why do you think our bodies make it constantly?
20/08/2021, 11:10 - James: Big Food keeping it a secret
20/08/2021, 11:10 - Mike: Then there'd be no poo for those of us in the know
20/08/2021, 11:10 - Wezz: Like I can find my wacky fetishes on PornHub. I'm 4 adjectives deep these days
20/08/2021, 11:11 - Paul: Right but surely you need a most viewed palate cleanser now and then
20/08/2021, 11:12 - Wezz: Fair; it's like the pickled ginger of the porn world.
20/08/2021, 11:13 - Wezz: (you'd know about that) üëÄ wayyy
20/08/2021, 11:13 - Wezz: Sorry, need to get to the pub already...
20/08/2021, 11:14 - James: Very strong, good effort
20/08/2021, 11:20 - Paul: ü•∫
20/08/2021, 11:21 - James: I've just seen that from official sources they've said that Onlyfans has no plans to move away from adult content, thanks for the FAKE NEWS
20/08/2021, 11:22 - Dayle: Mad
20/08/2021, 11:22 - Paul: +1 he's really mad
20/08/2021, 11:23 - Mike: Only fans ruined my niche porn subreddits
20/08/2021, 11:23 - Mike: Hope it dies a big smelly death

20/08/2021, 14:22 - Qck: Reddit ruined this by removing all nsfw content from the frontpage, can't imagine actively seeking out reddit porn unless you've exhausted all other options for uncircumcised ginger dicks and balls
20/08/2021, 14:24 - Qck: Also OF put in a ton of new regulations a few months ago to stop kids from using friends IDs to make $$$ as well as an actual tax reference that's required if you're earning X amount of money, so it's quite difficult to cheat the system - more so than it is to cheat any other porn aggregator
20/08/2021, 14:24 - Qck: Let them eat poo
20/08/2021, 14:25 - Mike: Senior Dev applied to a position at Nando's, all Dev roles applications start with a basic programming challenge that usually takes about an hour to be done in your own time.

He replied "I could just copy paste this from the internet so let's just not waste both our times and skip it."

20/08/2021, 14:42 - Derren: Clearly he was asking for a harder test
20/08/2021, 14:42 - Derren: Should have given him the thing you're working on to fix
20/08/2021, 14:44 - Mike: His GitHub (where developers store their personal code) is entirely empty, except where he has copied others code and renamed thing, probably to look like he's done a lot
20/08/2021, 14:44 - Mike: Things*
20/08/2021, 14:45 - Dayle: Ewww
20/08/2021, 14:47 - Mike: Reminds me of a CV I read where the guys opening line was "I could best be described as an enigma."

20/08/2021, 17:20 - Lee: Just to pique your interest, the film takes place in real time, in one room, and had a budget of $100,000
20/08/2021, 17:20 - Lee: Actually, that might deter you. But it's a good showing nevertheless.
20/08/2021, 17:33 - Mike: The man from earth is basically a one room movie made for 200k, would highly recommend if that's your thing

21/08/2021, 10:53 - Noone: whys he worse nowadays?
21/08/2021, 11:07 - Wezz: Not sure but I think it's him covering topics outside of his passion/interest. His formulaic style was super charming, you could tell he was getting a kick out of "until one run changed things forever..." now he's lacking that interest it kinda comes off as monotonous. More like reading the leaderboard using the waybackmachine each year.  I assume because he wasn't part of the scene he's reviewing he now depends on support from certain runners - which in turn makes the content second hand/dry. Still watch every vid - and they still blowing up - so what do i know

23/08/2021, 08:57 - Mike: You start weak and frail and gradually become strong until you peak, then you get to live your final days as a child in pure happiness
23/08/2021, 08:58 - Mike: Sign me up tbh, I'll take a poo up the bum for that
23/08/2021, 09:00 - Wezz: Would your photoreceptors emit light? Would you have *flashlight eyes*?
23/08/2021, 09:01 - Wezz: I'm looking for answers
23/08/2021, 09:06 - Mike: Only in certain situations, sometimes they'd emit no light of you go into a tunnel and such

23/08/2021, 10:23 - Wezz: Take that fee to the underground markets and you're making ¬£¬£.

25/08/2021, 10:26 - Mike: Spencer Elden, the man who was photographed as a baby on the album cover for Nirvana's Nevermind, is suing the band alleging sexual exploitation.

The cover depicts Elden as a four-month-old in a swimming pool, grasping for a dollar bill that's being dangled in front of him on a fishing line.

Now 30, Elden says his parents never signed a release authorising the use of his image on the album.

He also alleges the nude image constitutes child pornography.
25/08/2021, 10:27 - Mike: Imagine Nirvana going to jail for that lol
25/08/2021, 10:28 - Paul: I always wondered about that kid
25/08/2021, 10:28 - Paul: I would have thought it would be something to be proud of. Being on such an iconic album
25/08/2021, 10:28 - Mike: Yeh but money though
25/08/2021, 10:28 - Paul: Yeah true.
25/08/2021, 10:29 - Mike: Probably get settled out of court quietly, no one with money or power is going to risk CAI charges

25/08/2021, 14:23 - James: Yeah, big bad Google sent a cease and desist as it uses Youtube
25/08/2021, 14:26 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
25/08/2021, 14:26 - Kirky: as if its shutting down not just stopping youtube use
25/08/2021, 14:26 - Kirky: can still use soundcloud and spotify on it right?
25/08/2021, 14:27 - Wezz: It's okay, it'll be like a hydra... Groovy dies, 5 more copy cats pop up
25/08/2021, 14:27 - Mike: Release source code online, 5 million more pop up
25/08/2021, 14:28 - Mike: Bet it ate up a lot of Google resources though, all those wasted videos. It also had no ads right?
25/08/2021, 14:29 - Wezz: Yup - never did figure out exactly how it worked. I'm pretty sure the requests were made by the user initiating the command
25/08/2021, 14:30 - Wezz: Don't really know how that's possible through discord... just don't think they'd have their own servers pinging youtube for content a million times for free.
25/08/2021, 14:31 - Wezz: Also, youtube probably didn't feel the bandwidth. More concerned with ad revenue and content owners sueing them for enabling ad-free experiences
25/08/2021, 14:40 - James: Yeah, I think it's skipping their ads and subverting their non-reproducing license

25/08/2021, 18:50 - Dayle: I think you have to stream the youtube video through that and then output it in a stream to the voice output.
25/08/2021, 18:50 - Dayle: its abit weird, and doesnt really work in .net perhaps go might be easier or python
25/08/2021, 20:48 - Paul: The bummers bandwidth alone will bring too much attention
25/08/2021, 20:55 - Dayle: New world beta sep 9th
25/08/2021, 20:56 - Mike: I've done it in golang, it's pretty easy with packages like youtbdl
25/08/2021, 20:56 - Mike: Just costs server bandwidth
25/08/2021, 20:57 - Dayle: Ah nice show me some time
25/08/2021, 20:59 - Mike: Its the streaming costs that get you, you need to download the video (maybe just audio if possible?) The upload it via a discord client with an open mic, might not be too bad if it's just our discord though
25/08/2021, 21:00 - Kirky: Must be costing groovy guys a small fortune? How does it earn money lol
25/08/2021, 21:00 - Dayle: Anyway to make it event driven on a queue? I could host it on practically anything
25/08/2021, 21:01 - Dayle: But yeah if its just our discord its fuck all
25/08/2021, 21:01 - Dayle: Ignore above statement im 7 beers deep
25/08/2021, 21:03 - Mike: Yeh I've always wondered how it's not bankrupting them
25/08/2021, 21:04 - Kirky: Record everything we say in chat and sell it on? üòÇ
25/08/2021, 21:04 - Dayle: 16 million servers, hmmm do they use our data?
25/08/2021, 21:04 - Paul: This can't be how they do it surely
25/08/2021, 21:09 - Mike: Tbh I'd assume they streamed the audio directly to discord, that would save them any downloading and uploading costs but seems like black magic to me
25/08/2021, 21:20 - Paul: I assumed they were somehow pushing the streaming cost over to the users
26/08/2021, 11:25 - Paul: Is there a difference in how much a fast charger actually "charges" your battery? I feel like whenever I use one it goes up to 100% but seems to drain way quicker
26/08/2021, 11:26 - James: Definetely no. Fast-charging send more ampere to the battery. When a battery is loaded, there it is, it doesn't matter how fast you reach the charge level. What fast-charge affect is not the draining but the "lifespan" of a battery, low ampere charging doesn't stress the battery but take much longer.
26/08/2021, 11:26 - James: I'll take what is Google for 300 Alex
26/08/2021, 11:27 - Paul: Weird I wonder why I seem to experience that then. I guess it must just be coincidental
26/08/2021, 11:28 - James: Could be the way you use it, for example if you only use non-fast chargers at work, but don't really use your phone while working, it might be situational. The other part may just be you've switched to fast charger at a point your phone is now old enough to not have as much battery capacity
26/08/2021, 11:30 - Paul: It's more that my fast charger broke so I used an older one. Normally when I pick up my phone from charging it drops to like 95% instantly. Whereas with the old slow one is stayed at 100% for like 5 minutes
26/08/2021, 11:31 - Mike: Temperature could be a factor, impacts the charger reading I think
26/08/2021, 11:31 - Paul: My phone rarely lasts a whole day. It's normally dead by the time I go home from work and I barely use it. Whereas today it's still at 87%
26/08/2021, 11:32 - Dayle: perhaps your battery capacity is reduced, you can check that i think
26/08/2021, 13:02 - Piper: Maybe you're just an idiot
26/08/2021, 13:02 - Derren: You should never charge your phone to 100% anyway lol
26/08/2021, 13:03 - Derren: Nice way to fuck the battery up, batteries are in their worst state when close to fully charged and when low charge / empty for prolonged periods
26/08/2021, 13:04 - Derren: What you use to charge your phone with is also very important, get a similar charger to what your phone was supplied with in terms of watts/amps, it annoys me to see people charging their phones with the usb ports on their laptops/computers
26/08/2021, 13:05 - Piper: R u a b82re misto?

26/08/2021, 13:48 - James: If you charge your phone to 100% three times, then the ghost of Mr Samsung himself will appear in the night and kill you
26/08/2021, 13:55 - Derren: Not hard to look this stuff up

27/08/2021, 15:44 - Lee: Also, guarantee the person who bought them is related to him. Just money moving innit.
27/08/2021, 15:51 - Mike: My theory is that people are banking the boy becomes famous, then they can say they bought one of his early works
27/08/2021, 15:51 - Mike: Otherwise pile of bollocks
27/08/2021, 15:53 - Lee: It's like with art. Your mum just buys your art for thousands of pounds and then stupid people think your art is worth something and also pay thousands for it.

27/08/2021, 16:20 - Derren: Did you watch this video recently? xD
27/08/2021, 16:20 - Derren: People are doing the same with old video games, pretending to sell and just buying it themselves to inflate the price meanwhile owning the company that grades the games value and also the company that sells / auctions the gmaes
27/08/2021, 16:21 - Lee: I didn't. It's just a standard scam that's been going on for centuries! Look at the Russians and their art.

01/09/2021, 22:51 - Lockers: No I get that just saying it's making the process kinda pointless. Therefore not really promoting it
01/09/2021, 22:52 - Paul: Yeah well I doubt the antivax crowd really think it through like that. They'll see it as proof that they all work lol assuming he doesn't die
01/09/2021, 22:57 - Lockers: Just imagine...
01/09/2021, 23:04 - Mike: afaik its actually in trials to be tested as a possible covid medicine with anecdotal evidence from third world countries where people are taking it and improving, issue being those places you are likely to have worms/parasites too
01/09/2021, 23:05 - Mike: I didn't say promoting it scientifically, if people hear "CELEBRITY X TOOK HORSE DEWORMER AND SURVIVED" they assume its a cure. Indirectly, I'd call that promoting it
01/09/2021, 23:05 - Paul: What kind of dogshit trials wouldn't control for people having worms when testing a dewormer
01/09/2021, 23:05 - Mike: anecdotal evidence trials
01/09/2021, 23:06 - Paul: ü§Æ
01/09/2021, 23:06 - Paul: Was Rogan vaccinated? Can't find a source
01/09/2021, 23:08 - Mike: Don't believe so, afaik hes been the "healthy people don't need it, just the obese" crowd for a while
01/09/2021, 23:09 - Paul: Yeah but I also saw a bunch of people saying he is so I wasn't sure
01/09/2021, 23:12 - Mike: I mean either way its not like we should be listening to a man who became famous for being punched repeatedly for medical advice üòÇ
01/09/2021, 23:13 - Paul: I read that as him being famous for being punched for medical advice
01/09/2021, 23:13 - Mike: A PPV event I'd actually pay to view?
01/09/2021, 23:14 - Paul: *smack* TELL ME IF I'VE GOT KIDNEY STONES DAMNIT
02/09/2021, 06:58 - Wezz: Imagine following Rogan for medical advice... guy's been juiced on HRT for half his life. Would usually say don't discredit a drug based on its original indication, but this isn't even an antiviral drug so would be surprised if trials came back successful.
02/09/2021, 06:59 - Wezz: Fact check: Rogan (mostly) got famous for hosting US Feat Factor. Followed by a mediocre comedy career. Despite being a commentator for UFC he hasn't fought in the organisation, or in competition since he was a young man.
02/09/2021, 08:35 - Mike: Fear factor? Christ now I feel old
02/09/2021, 08:35 - Mike: Thanks a lot French wezz
02/09/2021, 08:40 - Wezz: Bonjour Monsieur, manger le cheval m√©dicament
02/09/2021, 08:41 - James: No, feat factor
02/09/2021, 08:44 - Wezz: I actually meant to write Feet Factor. It's like X Factor. Which is like X Files.
02/09/2021, 08:46 - Mike: "Skully, this man has been trampled to death."

"Moulder, that's not unusual."

"From the inside out..."

OooowwoooooOooooo
02/09/2021, 08:46 - Mike: Anyway that's how my pitch failed
02/09/2021, 08:49 - Wezz: Could have leant into X Factor and gone all Tom Jones in the middle.

Cue Rogan:

02/09/2021, 11:59 - Mike: Are they still beating their rugs outside their windows into the street?
02/09/2021, 12:00 - Mike: Probably the cause, just moving dust around
02/09/2021, 12:02 - Wezz: I think you've cracked it, some kinda precipitation of dust going on. They're scrubbing so hard..the water is brown but the streets're still dirty. Don't hug me I'm scared had it right

02/09/2021, 13:42 - Qck: Let them eat dong?
02/09/2021, 13:44 - Qck: Honestly annoying that Dayle is making his photos explode, was telling everyone I was in Spain and was relying on the pictoral updates
02/09/2021, 13:44 - Mike: Common myth actually, Jack never said let them eat dong. He said let them eat HIS dong.
02/09/2021, 13:46 - Paul: He actually said one small dong for *a* man one giant dong for mankind

03/09/2021, 08:46 - Mike: Yeh, if I'm seriously debugging I might turn it off entirely
03/09/2021, 08:53 - James: I recommend the Hollow Knight soundtrack. Not only is it really nice to listen to in the background, but that entire game is about bugs.
03/09/2021, 09:35 - Paul: Oh shit that's when you know it's serious
03/09/2021, 09:37 - Nathan: Damn son those frenchies got it right! Fuck wapping your dick out next to someone who uses the urinal next to you
03/09/2021, 09:40 - Paul: Paris is so shit he's giving us tours of bathrooms
03/09/2021, 09:47 - James: Nathan your insecurity is showing, I aim to establish alpha status against the people in the neighbouring urinals
03/09/2021, 09:48 - James: Yeah, I must say that Alex's tour he gave me of Paris a couple of years ago was much more cultured
03/09/2021, 09:56 - Alex: Hold on, one of the highlights of our trip was the airbnb toilet....
03/09/2021, 09:56 - James: Yeah, but that was a shared discovery, not part of the planned tour
03/09/2021, 09:57 - James: The Airbnb we stayed at had an enchanted toilet, and it was amazing
03/09/2021, 09:57 - James: It was basically the ET toilet from Bob's burgers
03/09/2021, 09:58 - Alex: It had a seat warmer and night light
03/09/2021, 09:58 - James: and a heated bidet and bum drier
03/09/2021, 10:26 - Wezz: Did it have a microwave?
03/09/2021, 10:32 - James: Yeah, blitz my bum into the 31st century
03/09/2021, 10:35 - Wezz: Well Parisian toilets aren't what they used to be.. most barely flush. American style
03/09/2021, 10:36 - Wezz: Except they're missing that little poo platform that the yanks have. Always nice to take a look at your log, make sure it's healthy, wave it goodbye

03/09/2021, 12:34 - Paul: lmao
03/09/2021, 12:34 - James: Does he go to restaurants and complain that his steak wasn't Spanish
03/09/2021, 12:34 - James: Fuck this guy

03/09/2021, 12:41 - Mike: Dear beloved customer,

I'm sorry to hear the app I made did not meet your expectations of being universally translated. If you haven't already refunded the cost, know that I will invest every cent of your ‚Ç¨1 into hiring a translator. Do you know anyone who is willing to work for roughly 0.00000008¬¢ a word?
03/09/2021, 12:41 - Wezz: Are there any competitor apps we can buy and 1 star for not being available in Swahili?
03/09/2021, 12:41 - Mike: Google actually offers it for 17p a word I think
03/09/2021, 12:42 - Wezz: Started so well..
03/09/2021, 12:43 - Mike: Did it?
03/09/2021, 12:43 - Mike: I'd be perturbed if someone called me a beloved customer, unless they were JAPANESE of course
03/09/2021, 12:43 - Mike: ??? Thanks auto correct
03/09/2021, 12:44 - Wezz: Why must you exclaim the word Japanese
03/09/2021, 12:45 - Mike: Even my auto correct is making fun of my Asian fetishism
03/09/2021, 12:45 - James: Your autocorrect is comedy genius as always
03/09/2021, 12:50 - Wezz: I'd go full seppuku.

Dear beloved customer,

I'm sorry to hear the app I made did not meet your expectations. I have not slept since your review, your three
 precious words remain drilled into my subconscious every waking minute of my existence.
I aim that one day, I will please you senpai, until then, I am forever in your debt.

- Mikeru
03/09/2021, 12:50 - Wezz: Maybe stick the word JAPANESE in there some where
03/09/2021, 12:52 - Paul: I do love a bit of JAPANESE
03/09/2021, 12:53 - James: Dear most glorious purveyor of applications,

Your etching into the digital fabric of my professional dignity have seared onto my very soul. Nary again shall I consider myself worthy of the hard earned money of those gracious enough to provide for me and mine. We shall starve, for it is what we deserve. Our ignorance shall be our headstone, our shame, the coffin.

So long fair world, we took you for granted one too many times.

Mike

03/09/2021, 14:07 - Mike: Estimado proveedor de aplicaciones m√°s glorioso,

Su grabado en el tejido digital de mi dignidad profesional ha grabado en mi alma. Nunca m√°s me considerar√© digno del dinero ganado con tanto esfuerzo por aquellos lo suficientemente amables como para mantenerme a m√≠ y a los m√≠os. Nos moriremos de hambre, porque es lo que nos merecemos. Nuestra ignorancia ser√° nuestra l√°pida, nuestra verg√ºenza, el ata√∫d.

Hasta luego, mundo justo, te dimos por sentado demasiadas veces.

04/09/2021, 08:21 - Wezz: Was told anti bribery laws for French health staff are super strict. Like you gotta declare everything over 30 euro. Also the exhibition halls (where companies set up stands) aren't allowed to give away any free goods due to French law). Can't even give out free coffee.

04/09/2021, 19:22 - Qck: What is McDonald's brand identity on with that blue sticker
04/09/2021, 19:23 - Wezz: Out here solving dangerous mysteries. So "Chinoise" is Sweet and Sour. Creamy Deluxe is sour cream. Bbq and Curry are identical to our UK equivalents.
04/09/2021, 19:23 - Wezz: Seriously. This burger is built different. Packaging is premium

04/09/2021, 19:27 - Qck: They don't even melt the cheese huh, just here you go, you want cheese here it is fucker
04/09/2021, 19:27 - Wezz: Identical to UK sweet and sour which I'm a fan of. I'll crack one of the sachets now
04/09/2021, 19:28 - Wezz: I think they were depending on the oignons to melt the cheese, but they're barely warm.
04/09/2021, 19:29 - Qck: If you could only eat one chinese dish for life what would it be?

Ima go duck pancakes before anyone else takes it
04/09/2021, 19:29 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
04/09/2021, 19:30 - Qck: It's not like mayo with herbs, it is mayo with herbs
04/09/2021, 19:30 - Mike: Any succulent Chinese meal
04/09/2021, 19:31 - Qck: Does come with a free groping
04/09/2021, 19:36 - Wezz: Solid 8/10. Blue cheese is weird and doesn't fit the mcdonalds flavour profile. We should have wedges available 24/7 like the French do. CHINESE sauce fantastic. Oops autocorrect
04/09/2021, 19:37 - Lockers: Szechuan?!
04/09/2021, 19:38 - Qck: So its settled that the chinese meal you would solely eat is a bucket of sweet and sour mcdonalds sauce poured out individually sachet by sachet but only when marketed as classic chinese sauce
04/09/2021, 19:38 - Qck: Have you not been keeping up you dick and dorky dweeb
04/09/2021, 19:39 - Lockers: No please explain
04/09/2021, 19:41 - Qck: Dayle's been walking a lot, need I explain more?
04/09/2021, 19:51 - Paul: McDonald's has a whole gourmet burger menu thing over here. I assumed it was a McDonald's thing globally now? They are very fancy pansy. Had a mango chilli and avocado beef burger last year from there
04/09/2021, 19:53 - Lockers: Please
04/09/2021, 19:53 - Lockers: Fancy pansy
04/09/2021, 19:54 - Paul: Pantsy?
04/09/2021, 19:55 - Wezz: Gourmet UK stuff is super simple. Like a beef burger with a seeded brioche bun and a little salad in it. Or a BBQ 'roadhouse' chicken burger. They tend to come in the same McDonald's cardboard boxes. This was like a Five Guys burger
04/09/2021, 19:56 - Qck: We have flat whites if that helps
04/09/2021, 20:01 - Wezz: When will "flat white" become derogatory? PAWGs aside I think it's a serious issue.

06/09/2021, 15:22 - Dayle: Just you, your silly cunt.. anyway before this rat tried his edgy shit.. I think it's it's good idea to be honest albeit adding more of a void in the black supremecy.. what about the other ethnicities

06/09/2021, 15:24 - Qck: _What about the other ethnicities_

07/09/2021, 12:39 - Derren: üòÇ
07/09/2021, 12:44 - Mike: Thought this was going to be animal welfare group, just racists
07/09/2021, 12:56 - Derren: If they were animal welfare they would want to be vegan and promote that
07/09/2021, 12:56 - Derren: Most of the farming industry treats animals terrible
07/09/2021, 13:42 - Mike: Yeh but if we're just comparing execution methods, being stunned before death seems like a more responsible way to go right?
07/09/2021, 13:43 - Mike: Kosher meat has the same problem, no stunning allowed
07/09/2021, 13:43 - Derren: If you look into this stuff a lot of the time they aren't even stunned or not stunned properly, other instances include stuff like if a cow is pregnant when it's killed and they open it up and there's a live calf inside they smash it over the head with a blunt object
07/09/2021, 13:44 - Derren: In general farming practises are quite terrible and eating the amount of meat / dairy we do isn't a good thing, health wise or morally
07/09/2021, 13:44 - Derren: Why look at the last 5 seconds of an animals life that has been suffering for 1-2 years
07/09/2021, 13:45 - Mike: Do you think that's the industry norm? I have no idea but sounds like it wouldn't be to me
07/09/2021, 13:45 - Mike: Yeh for sure
07/09/2021, 13:46 - Mike: Can't argue with that, just arguing the point between stunned Vs non-stunned
07/09/2021, 13:47 - Derren: Pretty much is, the body that regulates this shit said that's the way you're supposed to take a calfs life if it's still alive in the mothers womb after it's been killed
07/09/2021, 13:47 - Mike: Also non stunned is probably getting a bolt gun to the brain rather than its throat slashed
07/09/2021, 13:47 - Derren: There's tons of mistreatment on farms of animals in general
07/09/2021, 13:48 - Derren: In this day and age I don't think dairy should even exist anymore and if we're to "have meat" it should be 2 times a week if that
07/09/2021, 13:48 - Dayle: No
07/09/2021, 13:49 - Mike: Already drinking my oat milk, loving it with coffee ‚òï
07/09/2021, 13:50 - Derren: Same for some time now, trying to cut dairy completely where I can, don't really eat chocolate etc anymore either and cooking a lot more vegan dishes and using vegan alternative meats etc
07/09/2021, 13:51 - Qck: Nothing wrong with impregnating a cow, bashing its young against the wall and keeping it in a state of artificial pregnancy to make sure its tits taste creamy
07/09/2021, 13:51 - Derren: üò≥
07/09/2021, 13:52 - Mike: Funny this came up on Star Trek: The Next Generation, show was in the late 80s. They pick up some alien race who want an animal killed and they're told fine but their chefs will have to do the butchering as no one on the star ship has eaten or prepared meat in centuries. Even called it uncivilised lol
07/09/2021, 13:52 - Qck: Sorry Derren forgot to add the /s
07/09/2021, 13:52 - Mike: Oh you'd prefer we do it to women instead? You make me sick
07/09/2021, 13:52 - Qck: It's why I drink only the finest cambodian breast milks
07/09/2021, 13:53 - Mike: I don't like chocolate milk sadly
07/09/2021, 13:53 - Qck: Monster
07/09/2021, 13:56 - Wezz: I'd have put myself up for adoption
07/09/2021, 13:57 - Wezz: To an Asian family ideally... Banana milk op
07/09/2021, 13:58 - Mike: Vanilla surely?
07/09/2021, 13:58 - Mike: I'll take either tbf, best milkshakes
07/09/2021, 14:00 - Wezz: My favourite is actually strawberry, banana close second. But strawberry doesn't cater to my racist repertoire
07/09/2021, 14:00 - Mike: For anyone thinking of traveling: https://apply.joinsherpa.com/travel-restrictions
Seems fairly accurate from what I've seen
07/09/2021, 14:04 - Wezz: Also, it might be obvious to most. But Halal simply means 'permitted'. For meat it involves slaughtering in certain (inhumane) ways‚Ä¶ praying etc. HOWEVER since seafood and other stuff is permitted. You can just call it Halal off the bat.

Know this for when I open my Halal seafood shop. And Kirky's Halal bakery.
07/09/2021, 14:10 - Mike: Is my shirt Halal?
07/09/2021, 14:11 - Wezz: Does it have a picture of prophet Muhammad on it?
07/09/2021, 14:11 - Noone: I've watched footage of bugmen literally torching dogs to death in preparation before eating them
07/09/2021, 14:13 - Noone: The suffering induced impacts the flavour
07/09/2021, 14:13 - Mike: .... not anymore
07/09/2021, 14:15 - Wezz: Still constructed from bacon though right?
07/09/2021, 14:22 - Paul: You'd be shocked at what is considered acceptable even in fairly "well" regulated facilities. Even the conditions required for free range are hugely stretched and manipulated. It's like that old saying if slaughterhouses were made of glass everyone would be vegetarian
07/09/2021, 14:23 - Paul: Yes.
07/09/2021, 14:24 - Paul: I'm not militant about this shit but my respect is gone when people aren't at least self reflective to a degree. At least making an effort to minimise their carbon footprint And the suffering they cause. Being conscious of these things is mega important.
07/09/2021, 14:25 - Paul: Which oat milk do you use? We've been struggling to find a good replacement that tastes as good. Found this alpro barista one that is quite good but it's super expensive
07/09/2021, 14:30 - Lee: Tea - Soya
Coffee - Almond
Cereal - Oat

They are my milk selections.
07/09/2021, 14:31 - Lee: imo the best Soya for tea is Alpro's 'Cuppa' (also small carton which is useful). The best Almond is also Alpro. But the best Oat is Oatly (light blue).
07/09/2021, 14:31 - Lee: ALL UNSWEETENED
07/09/2021, 14:31 - Dayle: <Media omitted>
07/09/2021, 14:33 - Wezz: Not tried almond milk. But oat milk is legit. Makes everything taste like cereal which is a bonus.
07/09/2021, 14:33 - Paul: üëåüèª
07/09/2021, 14:33 - Paul: I'll check out cuppa thanks
07/09/2021, 14:34 - Dayle: I only buy organic eggs as well fuck dem barn chickens, and when I can organic meats, I rarely drink milk as well so bun ya ting
07/09/2021, 14:35 - Paul: Gotta be careful though. Organic isn't a protected term. Sometimes you're paying more and it's basically a scam
07/09/2021, 14:36 - Qck: Booooooo
07/09/2021, 14:36 - Dayle: Yeah you can check on the box the code stamp 0 is organic sometimes they say that and they are  code 1 free range
07/09/2021, 14:36 - Wezz: Dayle dropping egg codes out like nobody's business
07/09/2021, 14:37 - Dayle: I think I had a rant the other day about buying tesco organic eggs and them being a code 1 fucking fuuuming
07/09/2021, 14:37 - Dayle: I'll see if I can find the pic
07/09/2021, 14:37 - Lee: Actually called 'My Cuppa'
07/09/2021, 14:37 - Wezz: I shit my eggs out myself, can't trust the supermarkets
07/09/2021, 14:37 - Lee: Go on Dayle!
07/09/2021, 14:37 - Paul: No sorry too late I've ordered 50 Cuppa
07/09/2021, 14:41 - Dayle: <Media omitted>
07/09/2021, 14:41 - Dayle: Fucking cunts
07/09/2021, 14:41 - Mike: I used Oatley for cereal or coffee, it's kinda nutty weirdly but goes great in coffee
07/09/2021, 14:41 - Mike: Mmm delicious caged
07/09/2021, 14:44 - Wezz: I find caged chickens lay eggs with a greater depth of flavour. To quote Paul; you know that old saying "God does not love those who have not suffered."
07/09/2021, 14:44 - Dayle: ü•≤

07/09/2021, 16:22 - Wezz: ...oh they're shitting on almond milk now lolz.
07/09/2021, 16:24 - Wezz: We need the cows to eat the plastic. Someone sort it out already. Weren't there plastic eating worms made? Just force feed the cows those, foie gras
07/09/2021, 16:31 - Mike: You telling me this isn't as simple as remove all cows to save the earth? fuck sake I'm out. Going to start burning petrol to keep my house warm now
07/09/2021, 16:32 - Wezz: Bloody Indians hogging all the cows man
07/09/2021, 16:34 - Derren: It all depends where shit is grown xD
07/09/2021, 16:36 - Wezz: Well this Dr Frank man Skyping from his garden has sorted me right out. Thanks Misto
07/09/2021, 16:39 - Mike: Almost at the end, glad they're turning it back on fossil fuels. Same shit with recycling, pushed onto consumers as if sorting out your plastics does fuck all.
07/09/2021, 16:40 - Lee: Fuck it. Gonna get a Big Mac on my way home.
07/09/2021, 16:41 - Dayle: Double dare you
07/09/2021, 16:45 - Derren: Do you know who started a lot of this recycling / reduce your carbon footprint shit? BP
07/09/2021, 16:45 - Derren: They spend a fuck ton of money every year on marketing this narrative, what an amazing world we live in
07/09/2021, 16:47 - Paul: Yeah I agree guys fuck capitalism
07/09/2021, 16:51 - Wezz: Hopefully, once all the fossil fuels are back into the atmosphere, a giant "Mission Complete" sign will appear and we can all move to the next better planet with less retards.
07/09/2021, 16:52 - Wezz: Or it'll do a backwards barrel-roll big bang bonanza

07/09/2021, 23:09 - Lee: Beautiful. Calming.
07/09/2021, 23:12 - Lee: Moonriver just dropped another percent.
07/09/2021, 23:13 - Lee: Don't worry, the Americans are finishing work. They'll buy the dip and all will be well in the morning.
07/09/2021, 23:14 - Wezz: *A Community-Led Sister Parachain on Kusama*
Moonriver is a companion network to Moonbeam and provides a permanently incentivized canary network. New code ships to Moonriver first, where it can be tested and verified under real economic conditions. Once proven, the same code ships to Moonbeam on Polkadot.

...I know some of these words
07/09/2021, 23:14 - Mike: No mentions of lambos? SELL
07/09/2021, 23:15 - Lee: Ahh yes, shipping those codes down the river.
07/09/2021, 23:15 - Lee: Exactly why I invested
07/09/2021, 23:15 - Wezz: I always thought of you as an incentivised canary network kinda guy Lee
07/09/2021, 23:16 - Lee: I thought it said domestic canary.
07/09/2021, 23:17 - Lee: A network of domesticated canaries.
07/09/2021, 23:17 - Lee: What have I done
07/09/2021, 23:19 - Wezz: Listen to yourself. A network of domesticated canaries. On some kind of MOON RIVER?
07/09/2021, 23:19 - Wezz: Are they onboard boats?!
07/09/2021, 23:19 - Lee: But, but the Kasama logo is literally a domesticated canary.
07/09/2021, 23:20 - Lee: Honestly though, what does this shit even mean? What does ANY of it actually do?
07/09/2021, 23:20 - Wezz: You got hit with the domesticated canary bait and switch? An expert manoeuvre
07/09/2021, 23:24 - Wezz: It does have meanings...mostly specific fintech purposes, but I like to just think of it like sommeliers.

Mmmm, this crypto tastes splendid. I'm getting subtle flavours of sister parachains, a depth of Kusama, with a unique body of Moonbeam. The hint of Polkadot really brings out the best in this coin. 8/10
07/09/2021, 23:24 - Qck: It is a good song though
07/09/2021, 23:28 - Mike: It makes the money printers go brrrrrrrrrrrrrr
08/09/2021, 08:26 - Paul: So much for that house
08/09/2021, 08:30 - Mike: It'll be back by end of sept
08/09/2021, 10:28 - Paul: Any way to get my covid app qr scanner to somehow work if my camera is fucked? Ive got the code screenshotted on my phone but the app doesn't have an option for that
08/09/2021, 10:31 - Paul: The front facing camera still works so if there's a way i can force it to use that I think it might Work? Maybe I'd need a mirror to reverse it though üòÖ
08/09/2021, 10:32 - Mike: Is this some kind of official app or can you not just find one where it let's you use the front camera?
08/09/2021, 10:32 - Paul: I've tried the two major official apps
08/09/2021, 10:33 - Paul: Covpass and corona warning app
08/09/2021, 10:43 - Noone: El Salvador is el nomore
08/09/2021, 10:45 - Wezz: There're online tools that scan images e.g. https://4qrcode.com/scan-qr-code.php
08/09/2021, 10:46 - Wezz: After all QR is just a string. Mirror shouldn't effect anything since it has 3 dots for orientation
08/09/2021, 11:00 - Derren: Get a new phone you pleb
08/09/2021, 11:00 - Derren: I linked you a few already
08/09/2021, 11:33 - Paul: Right but then how do I get it into the app
08/09/2021, 11:34 - Wezz: Should be able to just click the link that's generated from the webpage.
08/09/2021, 11:35 - Wezz: Link will launch in the app
08/09/2021, 11:35 - Wezz: Bingo bango Dr Fisher
08/09/2021, 11:35 - Paul: I tried it with Google lens
08/09/2021, 11:35 - Paul: And it just looked around for similar qr codes or something
08/09/2021, 11:36 - Wezz: Just upload screenshot to https://4qrcode.com/scan-qr-code.php
08/09/2021, 11:37 - Wezz: Sure you can find a front facing camera qr scanner if you looked too. But above will work for now.

09/09/2021, 15:28 - Noone: got a very different vibe than the original matrix films.. Doesn't look as grimey / dirty. Maybe because this is all in a new cycle
09/09/2021, 15:29 - Noone: not really sure what new philisophical concepts they'll explore with Neo having to wake up all over again, might be treading the same ground as the first film just with a different skin...

10/09/2021, 08:21 - Paul: Thoughts on limiting screen time for kids? Would you guys enforce screen time rules?
10/09/2021, 08:50 - Piper: Why not just castrate them like you did your dog
10/09/2021, 08:50 - Dayle: üò±üò±
10/09/2021, 08:50 - Paul: But I didn't castrate my dog
10/09/2021, 08:51 - Paul: He's got big floppy balls
10/09/2021, 08:54 - Piper: In honesty.. you got to fill there time with other stuff.. like music lessons or sports
10/09/2021, 08:54 - Piper: Its something you as parents need to organise instead of ignoring them
10/09/2021, 08:55 - Dayle: Limit when young then enable when old enough to understand allow more screen time freedom, I remember sneakin about getting screen time anyway so it's going to happen..
10/09/2021, 08:56 - Paul: I basically had no screen time limits but because I was sporty it wasn't an issue really. The second I got my own pc things changed though. And it's well different than when we were kids. They've all got their own tablets these days
10/09/2021, 08:58 - Dayle: I also think we are in a evolution stage and devices are subjectively becoming extensions of ourselves so the screen time argument will die out in future generations as we will eventually know no different
10/09/2021, 08:58 - Piper: Well computer games is a viable profession these days.. you as a father have a lot more experience.. so screen time could mean making sure they are in a good community wanting to get better
10/09/2021, 08:58 - Paul: Which is cool but also kinda scary
10/09/2021, 08:58 - Paul: Only in the same way that music can make you a rockstar
10/09/2021, 09:00 - Piper: But those who struggled to make it produced the best music
10/09/2021, 09:01 - Dayle: Yeah augmentation is when we pass that great filter really, enabling water breathing, consumption of methane and transform it oxygen, or further more removing the requirement of a resp system. Enabling space travel and planet exploration without lugging around oxygen
10/09/2021, 09:01 - Dayle: We could just sustain on a bland herbalife shake ü§£
10/09/2021, 09:04 - Paul: In a lot of ways I think we need to, as they say now, touch grass. Literally though. Get more back into nature and away from our synthetic lives. Whilst I love tech and the progress we make. You gotta acknowledge it's not doing great for our mental well being. Especially social media
10/09/2021, 09:04 - Derren: The main problem you'll have is kids play with each other online now, when we were kids there wasn't really the Internet like we have now, all consoles were offline etc, I guess it depends what age you're referring to, giving a tablet to a 3 year old as
A distraction probably isn't the best thing to do
10/09/2021, 09:06 - Paul: And the millions that dedicated their time and effort and never made anything or got anywhere? You shouldn't get in to these sorts of hobbies with pipe dream aspirations imo
10/09/2021, 09:07 - Paul: Yeah I think this is really true. There's a huge difference between social gaming with family and friends on the sofa and gaming in a dark room with headphones.
10/09/2021, 09:07 - Paul: And that's coming from someone who obviously enjoys the latter
10/09/2021, 09:08 - Paul: I don't think I like the idea of these blanket screen time rules though. I think it works way better done proactively and balanced better by discussion
10/09/2021, 09:12 - Mike: Ban on social media outright, limit on screen time which can be extended by balancing with other doing other activities
10/09/2021, 09:12 - Derren: <Media omitted>
10/09/2021, 09:13 - Piper: Some people can't settle and live to them boring lives
10/09/2021, 09:14 - Piper: Shouldn't stunt people trying to create something new
10/09/2021, 09:27 - Nathan: I don't think it should be so much a conscious decision of "only 1 hour of screen time" it should be a conscious decision that you are doing other things going to parks, learning to ride bikes/scooters, kicking a ball around a field. Fill there time with other activities other than 3 hours a day of "mums phone" or there own tablet at 2 years old
10/09/2021, 09:32 - Derren: THEIR
10/09/2021, 09:33 - Mike: Your*
10/09/2021, 09:34 - Derren: Balance / discipline / understanding / respect are much more important when raising children, a lot of people miss these qualities, people put screens in front of their kids because they don't know how to raise them and the screens get a bad rep rather than playing incompetent people, same shit with video games causing people to become school shooters etc
10/09/2021, 09:34 - Derren: Also important to teach your kids the correct your, you're etc
10/09/2021, 10:08 - Paul: Derren hot on it with the good takes lately
10/09/2021, 10:08 - Paul: But that isn't what I'm saying. Creativity is important and everyone should strive to expand their horizons. But the fact that 0.001% of people in those hobbies make a career out of it shouldn't be a consideration
10/09/2021, 10:15 - Paul: Outright social media ban is tough to implement and maintain. Firstly you don't want to alienate them from their peers and secondly it's easy for them to bypass. And may even have the adverse effect of making it more appealing. Forbidden fruit
10/09/2021, 10:16 - Paul: And limit on screen time is either going to end up as an arbitrary rule or just not be used at all. I'm all for setting boundaries but we know better than most that screen time is not created equally. Sometimes it can be very healthy and productive and I wouldn't want to limit that as much as other screen time activities that I'd try to discourage
10/09/2021, 10:25 - Paul: https://www.wahl-o-mat.de/bundestagswahl2021/app/main_app.html

German elections are coming up. For anyone interested you can take this test to see which party you most closely align with. You'll need to use a web-translator though
10/09/2021, 10:53 - Kirky: Do you get a knock on the door if its nazi party?
10/09/2021, 10:54 - Paul: Few of Julia's friends got a very high support of the AfD which is the pretty far right party
10/09/2021, 10:54 - Paul: Conversations with them can be exhausting
10/09/2021, 10:55 - Piper: I miss the days where you leave a baby in the jungle with a knife.. those days created the strongest adults

10/09/2021, 17:28 - Dayle: Awesome
10/09/2021, 17:29 - Mike: Seems like a perfect system to me
10/09/2021, 17:30 - Mike: I emailed to confirm beforehand they accepted the NHS app and they replied yes üôÑ

10/09/2021, 17:57 - Lee: Where do you leave your cash and cards? In the tent to get stolen?
10/09/2021, 17:57 - Lee: Lol. Tents. As if, we old now.

12/09/2021, 07:40 - Paul: Rip eardrums

12/09/2021, 16:56 - James: In theory distilled plums should be nice, but alcohol ruins everything
12/09/2021, 17:00 - Lockers: YOU TAKE THAT BSCK
12/09/2021, 17:00 - Lockers: Back
12/09/2021, 17:24 - Mike: <Media omitted>
12/09/2021, 17:34 - Qck: Someone's been at the distilled plums
12/09/2021, 18:00 - Mike: <Media omitted>
12/09/2021, 18:01 - Mike: He came on stage, thanked all the staff and then said "woah woah woah, wait a minute what's this". That was 5 minutes ago, pure confusion.

12/09/2021, 18:22 - Dayle: No I will not conform
12/09/2021, 18:23 - Mike: Actually surprised how much space there is in this crowd, dunno if it's cos this act is a nobody or people are scared of rona or what
12/09/2021, 18:25 - Paul: It's sunday

12/09/2021, 18:30 - Nathan: Neverrrr
12/09/2021, 18:30 - Mike: Masked Wolf just brought out a, what I can only assume is Romanian, local talent
12/09/2021, 18:30 - Mike: Crowd went nuts, I'm just confused
12/09/2021, 18:31 - Paul: Remember in Prague with that danit guy or whatever it was
12/09/2021, 18:31 - Paul: Where his name was actually in acrylic but we just said the letters lol
12/09/2021, 18:34 - Mike: Looool Danit
12/09/2021, 18:34 - Mike: Actually hilarious
12/09/2021, 18:44 - Mike: <Media omitted>
12/09/2021, 19:35 - Wezz: Thanks for standing through his (likely awful) set to hear his one viral tune. That's true love
12/09/2021, 19:37 - Wezz: Gotta get those cheap pops somehow üòÇ poor guy
12/09/2021, 22:34 - Wezz: @447835575116 , I really like you're beard.
12/09/2021, 22:34 - Wezz: Your one of the best bearded men I know.
12/09/2021, 22:44 - Mike: <Media omitted>
12/09/2021, 22:45 - Kirky: That's something I can get behind
12/09/2021, 22:47 - Paul: Your not clever
12/09/2021, 22:50 - Wezz: They've spiked you're drink with multivitamins üëÄ
12/09/2021, 22:51 - Mike: This is pure energy
13/09/2021, 00:24 - Mike: Your honour, I'll take 6
13/09/2021, 12:35 - Mike: Can someone just kill me so I don't need to travel home
13/09/2021, 12:35 - Mike: I think I'd prefer that
13/09/2021, 12:44 - James: If you get an exit seat again you could just open the door
13/09/2021, 12:48 - Mike: Tempting
13/09/2021, 13:12 - Wezz: Last day Benecasim all over again?
13/09/2021, 13:15 - Mike: No I'm conscious in this misery
13/09/2021, 13:17 - Wezz: Just need someone to drag your body to the nearest transport hub
13/09/2021, 13:17 - Dayle: Bang another skittle and get home pinging haha
13/09/2021, 14:14 - Mike: Romania, or at least Bucharest though. Would recommend, wish I had more time to go and site see but the festival took up the lot basically.
13/09/2021, 15:49 - Lockers: Top tip, if you're struggling with temperature regulation if you sit in the toilet and flush it it let's a nice cooling flow of air through. Spent the whole journey back in there one flight back from Madrid
13/09/2021, 15:55 - James: Fuck the people that actually need the toilet right?
13/09/2021, 16:09 - Qck: One whiff of that toilet gas is equivalent to my monthly quota of bong rips
13/09/2021, 16:28 - Lockers: There were two. I also sat at the front with the air hostesses as they thought I was travel sick
13/09/2021, 16:36 - Qck: Sounds like you were being restrained, as your behaviour (and personality) aligns with a shoebomber
13/09/2021, 16:52 - Wezz: Top tip, fuck over everyone on the flight because of your poor life decisions, which include sitting in the airplane toilet flushing it in an attempt to cool down your balls.
13/09/2021, 16:57 - Lockers: Yeah see you get it
13/09/2021, 17:01 - Derren: https://www.boots.com/kool-n-soothe-migraine-4-pack-10029380 I take these if I'm traveling far, stick em on all parts of your body
13/09/2021, 17:02 - Derren: You can also take the cooling gel you buy for your muscles (opposite of deep heat)
13/09/2021, 17:02 - Dayle: What's wrong with you all the planes are not hot lol
13/09/2021, 17:02 - Lockers: Oh I think you misunderstood, I was hanging out of my arse
13/09/2021, 17:02 - Derren: ah xD
13/09/2021, 17:07 - Paul: Reminds me of Mike dying in the toilet on the coach
13/09/2021, 17:08 - Paul: Travelling hungover is fucking awful you idiots should plan for that
13/09/2021, 17:16 - Wezz: I'm already planning my next hungover journey in the plane toilets constantly flushing, looking forward to it.
13/09/2021, 17:19 - Dayle: Don't forget to be covered head to toe in cool packs
13/09/2021, 17:22 - Paul: It's no laughing matter Dayle people have been cooked alive with how hot planes are
13/09/2021, 17:23 - Dayle: Hotplaneitius the next covid I heard
13/09/2021, 17:23 - Paul: Is it contagious?
13/09/2021, 17:23 - Dayle: Only if you are hot
13/09/2021, 17:25 - Wezz: Dayle's a super spreader baby
13/09/2021, 17:25 - Wezz: SEXY BEAST
13/09/2021, 17:25 - Paul: Ok phew
13/09/2021, 17:26 - Wezz: Shave your beard and you'll be fine
13/09/2021, 17:31 - Paul: That's like the only part I like ffs
13/09/2021, 17:31 - Paul: It's "get a haircut goth" all over again

13/09/2021, 17:35 - Paul: Was it cooked in a plane
13/09/2021, 17:35 - Wezz: I helped her with her shopping last week...pretty sure I did an okay job. If not I guess I'll see you boys on the other side
13/09/2021, 17:37 - Wezz: It was a compliment my sexy bearded brethren
13/09/2021, 17:38 - Paul: Oh ‚ù§Ô∏è
13/09/2021, 17:53 - Mike: How sweet
13/09/2021, 17:53 - Mike: Make sure to clean the tray before returning
13/09/2021, 17:54 - Mike: Just landed back in blightey, didn't crash üòç
13/09/2021, 17:54 - James: Shame
13/09/2021, 17:55 - Wezz: She's an absolute sweetheart. Bloody delicious too. Good shout gonna clean it with my tongue
13/09/2021, 17:56 - Wezz: James is the type of person that only says this AFTER he knows you've landed safely. I'm all about hoping your plane crashes BEFORE you leave. #TrueFriendship
13/09/2021, 17:56 - Dayle: I was hoping the vitamins  were poison
13/09/2021, 17:57 - Dayle: üò±
13/09/2021, 17:58 - Mike: The boys have never been healthier amount of vitamins they consumed

13/09/2021, 18:22 - Dayle: Nice :)
13/09/2021, 18:27 - Mike: <Media omitted>
13/09/2021, 18:30 - Paul: James this isn't the S tier content you're known for. You're better than this
13/09/2021, 18:30 - Alex: It literally begins with an s, not sure what more he could have done?
13/09/2021, 18:31 - James: SometimeS leSS iS more
13/09/2021, 18:31 - Paul: Typical C tier
13/09/2021, 18:32 - Alex: Why'd you have to be so mean, I can now c tears from my eyes
13/09/2021, 18:32 - Paul: Was this before or after you swam in the hepatitis C
13/09/2021, 18:32 - Lockers: Get the fuck out my swamp
13/09/2021, 18:32 - James: It was only to C what he could C C C
13/09/2021, 18:33 - Paul: OUR SWAMP?
13/09/2021, 18:33 - Lockers: I don't c you in my swamp
13/09/2021, 18:55 - Derren: Shit in the tray and return it, assert your dominance so that the food continues to come
13/09/2021, 18:58 - Mike: Does this work on you?
13/09/2021, 19:00 - Derren: No!
13/09/2021, 19:04 - Alex: Dont shit in it, just flush air through it for hours while everyone waits for it
13/09/2021, 19:06 - Lockers: Unless you want it hot, right?!
14/09/2021, 10:45 - Dayle: Anyone wanna do valhiem again with the new update heart and home?
14/09/2021, 11:03 - Lee: Yes
14/09/2021, 11:09 - Piper: Reckon my castle is still standing?
14/09/2021, 11:09 - James: The trolls have moved in Piper
14/09/2021, 11:09 - Dayle: Castles dead mate
14/09/2021, 11:22 - Mike: Didn't stand the test of time
14/09/2021, 11:22 - Mike: Shoddy work Piper
14/09/2021, 14:00 - Wezz: Just had a nurse come to me and say "you're going to have an orgasm when you see my excel spreadsheet". Not sure how to feel about any of it..
14/09/2021, 14:00 - Dayle: Is she fit
14/09/2021, 14:01 - Wezz: Definite no.
14/09/2021, 14:01 - Mike: Oh fuck, did that saucy bitch use formulae?
14/09/2021, 14:01 - Mike: Oh Christ tell me she had drop downs
14/09/2021, 14:02 - Wezz: I taught her how to use dropdowns and named ranges. Imagine it's some badly implemented  clusterfuck of those
14/09/2021, 14:03 - Wezz: It's not even foreplay. If you're not rocking pivotgraphs, index/match, or formulas my guy is staying flaccid.
14/09/2021, 14:04 - Wezz: Pfft takes that VBA goodshit to get me off these days
14/09/2021, 14:04 - Dayle: That should be your tinder bio honestly
14/09/2021, 14:05 - Wezz: People be hitting me up with =SUM()

Straight in the bin
14/09/2021, 14:05 - Wezz: I've got _STANDARDS_
14/09/2021, 14:06 - Dayle: Q Q E W E W Q bin
14/09/2021, 14:08 - Wezz: Sometimes prem ejac to a well done bit of conditional formatting... guilty pleasure though
14/09/2021, 14:31 - Paul: Reverse the sexes and HR are getting a complaint
14/09/2021, 14:34 - Lockers: Dude get over it jeez
14/09/2021, 14:37 - Qck: Yeah men suffer greatly from reverse sexism
14/09/2021, 14:39 - Paul: Everyone has changed colours and I don't like it
14/09/2021, 14:40 - Wezz: When I read this back my body shudders in a disgust kinda way. She said it so clinically and non sexual. Defo creeped me out
14/09/2021, 14:40 - Qck: Question for all: when did you last take a shameful public poo?

NB: this can be a poo you did in a public stool or a specific instance of dropping trou when your guts betrayed you
14/09/2021, 14:41 - Wezz: Lockers got a new Security Code and it messed the colours up. Probably got his account phished again
14/09/2021, 14:41 - Qck: I took acid at my dad's reunion gig for Jesus Jones and ended up squatting next to a tree in kentish town during soundcheck, saw a mum and her kid walk past that very spot shortly after I had covered myself up
14/09/2021, 14:42 - Wezz: Why did you shit on a tree? Were there no toilets?
14/09/2021, 14:42 - Qck: I needed to get outside of the venue and then my guts needed to get outside of my anus
14/09/2021, 14:43 - Wezz: You gave me lots of context, just not enough for me to work that bit out.
14/09/2021, 14:43 - Wezz: Ahhh, the acid
14/09/2021, 14:44 - Qck: This was four years ago or so - am expecting more recent stories from the likes of Lockers and hiking Paul
14/09/2021, 14:51 - Wezz: I remember a particularly bad poo in festival toilets. I _had_ to go. Queued for a stupidly long time, one line for multiple cubicles. Walk to my cubicle and look inside to see the most disgusting mess of sick and shit and toilet paper all over the place. Floor was covered. Someone before me had put whole toilet rolls on the floor to use as stepping stones, but the shit had seeped through them and ruined any semblance of structural integrity. I remember looking back at the queue and there was no chance I'd be able to rejoin it. Just big gulped and went in. Hovered over where the toilet should have been and went for it, proper festival beer poo. No point in flushing, handle was a state too. Just got up and left, as I was walking away saw some tiny festival girl running to the cubicle with face glitter on, clearly bursting for the toilet.
Never looked back.
14/09/2021, 14:52 - Mike: She was never seen again.
14/09/2021, 14:53 - Mike: Did the acid help free you of your earthly shame or was the shame intensified as that family went past?
14/09/2021, 14:53 - James: I did one Saturday at a French rest stop, and everyone else in the car was waiting outside talking to some old bird from Oxford. Very off-putting when you can hear "Why is this taking so long, are you sure someone is in there" as I'm dropping a log in a metal toilet
14/09/2021, 14:54 - Qck: Glitter girls love faeces so you should have told her what was in store whilst licking your lips
14/09/2021, 14:55 - Qck: It gave me the urge to let them know what had just occured but I fought it
14/09/2021, 14:55 - Qck: Yesssss yessssssssss more shit stories guys come on
14/09/2021, 15:02 - Mike: Honestly don't remember last time I dropped a brown about town
14/09/2021, 15:03 - Mike: My ex has a homeless people problem in that they keep shitting on her housing communities electric gate, really conflicts her interests when she tries to help them and this is how they repay her lmao
14/09/2021, 15:22 - Paul: I like to think every person in that queue assumes the person in front of them is responsible
14/09/2021, 15:25 - Wezz: They left me with a poo tiramisu, layers of shit and toilet paper, I was merely a participant. Could understand how the German ww2 soldiers felt..
14/09/2021, 15:28 - Nathan: Sammmeeeee why does WhatsApp do this to me üò©üò≠üò≠
14/09/2021, 15:28 - Nathan: Messed me up man
14/09/2021, 15:28 - Dayle: Anyone got a good Spotify playlist

14/09/2021, 15:32 - Wezz: Never disappointed with BST......."MY LOVE üé∂"
14/09/2021, 15:47 - Paul: Speaking of poo in public. Mask on or off? I feel like both feel weird
14/09/2021, 15:48 - Dayle: Mask off. I have had 3 colds since the start of lockdown and no covid so fuck em
14/09/2021, 15:49 - Paul: Wouldn't this be an argument FOR them?
14/09/2021, 15:49 - Dayle: No, how am I getting colds with them on, I think dodging covid I was really lucky or asym
14/09/2021, 15:50 - Paul: We've been using FFP2 masks here for over a year. I think they are significantly better protection
14/09/2021, 15:50 - Paul: I don't know how you've gotten 3 colds. That's more than I've had in the last decade lol
14/09/2021, 15:51 - Paul: But I'm pretty sure all viral infections are way down since we've been using them. Statistically speaking
14/09/2021, 15:51 - Kirky: only makes sense
14/09/2021, 15:51 - Kirky: i got my sinus infection within like 2 weeks of not wearing a mask at work
14/09/2021, 15:52 - Kirky: after 0 colds for 18 months
14/09/2021, 15:53 - Paul: Yeah i dunno Dayle. Are you implying that you got more colds because of the mask?
14/09/2021, 15:57 - Dayle: No I just mean its finna get you one way or another
14/09/2021, 15:57 - Wezz: Yeah, what are you _*IMPLYING*_ Dayle? Always IMPLYING all the time
14/09/2021, 15:57 - Dayle: So no mask I'm double jabbed so that might esque my choice
14/09/2021, 16:00 - Paul: But aren't there places it's required?
14/09/2021, 16:00 - Dayle: Spain was locked up had to wear a mask everywherr
14/09/2021, 16:03 - Mike: Probably the ciggies and drinks you share around the camp fires mate
14/09/2021, 16:03 - Mike: I saw this, lockdown could be the cause though rather than masks
14/09/2021, 16:03 - Wezz: Or the 7 gram rocks üëÄ
14/09/2021, 16:05 - Mike: I had opposite, caught covid from Piper the NHS super spreader but haven't have a cold in ages. I think if we all put at least 3 more anecdotes in this chat we can have consensus on the mask debate? Hows my research standards @447561062944
14/09/2021, 16:06 - Wezz: Better than my aunties so I'll let it slide
14/09/2021, 16:07 - Mike: Sorry mate I'm going to need a better worded recommendation for the tabloids, maybe this will help *slides gaming chair under your departments door*
14/09/2021, 16:08 - Wezz: üëÄ IS THAT THE BIG JIZZA 3000? üí∫
14/09/2021, 16:08 - Wezz: With the retractable footrest!?
14/09/2021, 16:08 - Paul: "This meta-analysis of the 21 studies provides the latest state-of-art evidence on the efficacy of masks in preventing the transmission of RVIs. Our data show that the protective effects of masks against RVIs were not only significant for both HCWs and non-HCWs, but also consistent between Asian and Western populations.
14/09/2021, 16:08 - Paul: "
14/09/2021, 16:09 - Mike: You trying to tell me Asian breath is the same as Western breath?
14/09/2021, 16:09 - Wezz: This is Grade A irrefutable evidence. Nobel prize worthy, huge congratulations and credit to the authors.
14/09/2021, 16:10 - Wezz: This is some kinda Facebook post, back of the napkin level evidence. Disgraceful. I will be writing a letter to the editor.
14/09/2021, 16:10 - Mike: That's some trump level recommendation there, best words
14/09/2021, 16:11 - Paul: Sorry I meant: Well I haven't had a cold so...
14/09/2021, 16:14 - Wezz: Just what we're looking for. Will you please join our news station for an interview? We'll pay you thousands.
14/09/2021, 16:14 - Mike: *launches in second gaming chair, killing an intern*
14/09/2021, 16:20 - Wezz: 42% of mask wearers have vitamin D deficiency

>50% of mask wearers in OECD countries are overweight

_swinging around on my two BIG JIZZA 3000s, connected together with footrests out in hammock formation_
14/09/2021, 16:24 - Wezz: 50% of mask wearers will get cancer in their lifetime. The facts don't lie.

_Psst, any new gamer chairs going?_
14/09/2021, 17:23 - Nathan: Is that the one that has the interchangeable anal dildo and the semen catcher? Lovely model

14/09/2021, 18:19 - Nathan: "Wait is that and IF(ANDDDDDD....  I'm done"
14/09/2021, 20:05 - Paul: Can't wait to see how you blame this on the Chinese
14/09/2021, 20:21 - Noone: You're right comrade, this flavour paste sure is yummy! Long live the state

15/09/2021, 00:09 - Qck: Yes that's what I said
15/09/2021, 00:13 - Mike: Such a shame, always enjoyed his nursery rhyme
15/09/2021, 00:16 - Qck: If anyone enjoyed/hasn't seen norm's youtube chatshow it's all archived here: https://archive.org/details/Norm_Macdonald_Live
15/09/2021, 07:37 - Paul: I was reading that infant development in new borns is below the mean during covid. It's being attributed to social distancing lessening their stimulation. Pretty interesting proof of concept
15/09/2021, 09:30 - Derren: https://www.hotukdeals.com/deals/deliveroo-plus-free-for-a-year-with-amazon-prime-3793373
15/09/2021, 09:45 - Noone: But how does this affect me, the consumer?
15/09/2021, 09:50 - Wezz: Was beginning to worry you'd lost your love for hotukdeals... gotta renew my prime but this isn't even that great. Only get free delivery on >25¬£ orders with deliveroo+. I'm an old man who eats for two and barely hit ¬£15
15/09/2021, 09:52 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
15/09/2021, 10:01 - Derren: What cheap places you eating at man
15/09/2021, 10:06 - Wezz: I have this calculation: take my body weight in KG, divide by 100, times by 6. Always round up, even at X.01.

Weighted 1.0 for lunch, x1.5 for dinner

And that's how many double cheeseburgers I order from McDonalds
15/09/2021, 10:08 - Derren: üòÇ
15/09/2021, 10:09 - James: On the Sam Wezz diet, I can eat 15 double cheeseburgers a day!
15/09/2021, 10:12 - Wezz: Thanks for being a loyal customer, James. We really appreciate you and your inspiring journey.
15/09/2021, 11:15 - Noone: Truly inspiring
15/09/2021, 13:51 - Wezz: I, for one, really like Roman numerals.
15/09/2021, 13:51 - Dayle: Ayyye
15/09/2021, 13:51 - James: Very nice
15/09/2021, 13:55 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
15/09/2021, 14:02 - Mike: A furniture store keeps calling me.

All I wanted was one nightstand.

15/09/2021, 17:26 - Wezz: No one here man
15/09/2021, 17:41 - Paul: What you watching?
15/09/2021, 20:10 - Wezz: Marvel's Chinese recruitment movie. 10 rings and a dragon or whatever it's called
15/09/2021, 20:15 - Wezz: NOTBAD always feel like they tick off each cultures' tropes in a rather slapdash fashion. Even had the slowmo romancey shots you'd find in an Asian-novela. Full of action sequences
15/09/2021, 20:17 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
15/09/2021, 20:36 - James: It was pretty fun right? Nice homage to classic kung fu movies
15/09/2021, 20:56 - Wezz: Yeah loved the kung fu references, Tony Leung is pretty famous, not seen any of his stuff myself. Also, the family culture and general character development/motives were really well done.
15/09/2021, 21:13 - Paul: https://v.redd.it/1lvsxzmk5nn71
15/09/2021, 21:15 - Derren: Used to do that on the door frame when this song came on

15/09/2021, 21:16 - Derren: advice for you guys
15/09/2021, 21:18 - Wezz: Loool brilliant. Piper loves a good late-game scaler!
15/09/2021, 21:19 - Paul: My thing was way funnier
15/09/2021, 21:20 - Wezz: Sorry, Misto did that thing where he posts something straight after you post something and then your post is gone forever
15/09/2021, 21:21 - Paul: He waits for me to post I swear
15/09/2021, 21:21 - Derren: Paul posted something?
15/09/2021, 21:21 - Wezz: He posted again, quick find a hotukdeal
15/09/2021, 21:21 - Paul: I can't take any of you seriously anymore since the name colour change
15/09/2021, 21:22 - Wezz: Ahhh, the great colour change of '21
15/09/2021, 21:22 - Lockers: Oh yous too
15/09/2021, 21:22 - Lockers: Yours
15/09/2021, 21:22 - Wezz: *Yaws

15/09/2021, 21:24 - Paul: The two yutes
15/09/2021, 22:15 - Derren: I had the vid I sent for a few hours I just forgot you guys were nerds like me and then your post reminded, also took your link and sent it to others wehay
15/09/2021, 22:15 - Paul: You all steal my hilarious things that I steal from reddit

16/09/2021, 08:53 - Wezz: ThE FuTuRe!
16/09/2021, 08:56 - Paul: Why do these videos always have studio quality cameras with perfect clarity. It's the most unrealistic part lol
16/09/2021, 08:57 - Paul: Just did a poo and it was jet black. What is your diagnosis poo Dr wezz
16/09/2021, 09:00 - Derren: If you're a company you should be able to afford decent meeting room cameras, decent laptops nowadays have good cameras so xD
16/09/2021, 09:01 - Wezz: Can't wait to see a live, tiled, big Sue blown up in the background of her slides looking confused
16/09/2021, 09:01 - Wezz: Pregnant
16/09/2021, 09:01 - Paul: No online meeting camera looks like that
16/09/2021, 09:02 - Mike: Most laptops have cameras in them that are quite good
16/09/2021, 09:02 - Mike: A meeting room microphone is pretty handy though, so everyone can mute their laptops
16/09/2021, 09:20 - Wezz: Our new setup at work has a combi meeting room mic and built in camera, it uses facial recognition with audio to focus in, and zoom, on who's talking. Brand new, only really works well if the room is properly setup (ours isn't _that_ good). Meetings never look like the commercials..partially because we don't have oak furniture casually in the background, well lit rooms, and no one smiles like serial killers.
16/09/2021, 10:21 - Paul: I just don't think the software can even upload quality that high. I've never seen it
16/09/2021, 10:21 - Paul: That's like 4k res on everyone
16/09/2021, 11:37 - Wezz: Did anyone here ever find 'dabbing' cool? Apparently it was cool at some point
16/09/2021, 11:38 - James: I think I do now, but it's under about 8 levels of irony
16/09/2021, 11:55 - Paul: Was for an age group below even our youngest
16/09/2021, 11:58 - Mike: Whatever old man, I'm going to dab in my next meeting and prove I'm still hip
16/09/2021, 12:06 - Paul: I love the way you're not even sure

16/09/2021, 12:09 - Mike: He's probably already fiddled your future kiddies
16/09/2021, 12:09 - James: Children in the future are downloaded over 5G
16/09/2021, 12:10 - Mike: Much like Corona
16/09/2021, 12:10 - Lockers: You're darker green and not blue
16/09/2021, 12:10 - Lockers: My WhatsApp seems clearer
16/09/2021, 12:11 - Paul: He's envious now.
16/09/2021, 12:11 - James: WTF I was orange before? You don't what you've got until it's gone...
16/09/2021, 12:11 - Nathan: All the colours are wrong. Colour means nothing to me anymore
16/09/2021, 12:12 - Paul: James was orange before but he's like baby poo Brown now
16/09/2021, 12:12 - Mike: Why can't we set our own colours? I actively identify as brown
16/09/2021, 12:12 - James: Paul, you're a sicky green so don't you start
16/09/2021, 12:12 - Paul: You're blue which is bs because I'm always blue
16/09/2021, 12:12 - James: I've got him as Minty Mike
16/09/2021, 12:13 - Dayle: Mike is purple
16/09/2021, 12:13 - Mike: Are we each going to list off our contacts colours?
16/09/2021, 12:13 - Paul: Mike's blue still
16/09/2021, 12:14 - Dayle: No
16/09/2021, 12:14 - Mike: I'm colour blind so you're all still grey
16/09/2021, 12:14 - James: What makes a man turn neutral?
16/09/2021, 12:16 - Dayle: You better watch that tone
16/09/2021, 12:16 - Paul: Maybe nothing has changed except all of our perspectives
16/09/2021, 12:16 - Dayle: Maybe it's the Mandela effect ü§î
16/09/2021, 12:16 - Kirky: Dayles bluboi for me
16/09/2021, 12:16 - Dayle: Like cheese and onion walkers crisps being green
16/09/2021, 12:18 - Mike: Fooled me more than once
16/09/2021, 12:19 - Paul: Or flaming hot monster munch actually being spicy
16/09/2021, 12:22 - Dayle: Apprently it never happened
16/09/2021, 12:22 - Dayle: We are in alternate timeliness now boys

16/09/2021, 12:35 - Paul: Sorry other way around
16/09/2021, 12:36 - Paul: I like to think that means you've misunderstood their faces from shots in chat for the last 2 years as well
16/09/2021, 12:36 - Kirky: if youre confused wezz is the postman
16/09/2021, 12:36 - Nathan: I knew them by colours until the colours changed.... RIP me. And don't get me started on qck
16/09/2021, 12:37 - Paul: Is this true though? In the screenshot you've literally got kirky saved as wezz lmao
16/09/2021, 12:38 - Nathan: No that wasn't me that was someone else that's what confused me
16/09/2021, 12:38 - Nathan: Someone else has wezz saved as kirky

16/09/2021, 12:43 - James: Kirky made the best shortbread I ever tasted for LAN. I made some today and it pales in comparison.

16/09/2021, 18:02 - Lee: I've missed all the chat. But is WhatsApp brighter for everyone? Default mode and light mode are the same. Light.
16/09/2021, 18:05 - Lockers: Yeah I said this! But I thought it had more clarity
16/09/2021, 18:06 - Lee: I don't like it, so I've reverted to dark mode. But this hurts my eyes, too.
16/09/2021, 18:06 - Lockers: Mine was already dark anyway #equality

16/09/2021, 20:21 - Paul: My favourite show as a kid
16/09/2021, 23:07 - Lee: How old was Postman Pat when the series first began?
16/09/2021, 23:32 - James: Where was Postman Pat when the Westfold fell?
16/09/2021, 23:33 - Dayle: With his black and white cat, where else?
16/09/2021, 23:40 - Wezz: Does postman pat pay into his pension?

League client is staying boys.
17/09/2021, 00:15 - Wezz: *WILL THIS BE REPLACING THE CLIENTS FOR LEAGUE/VALORANT/TFT/ETC?*

"Nope! Each game-specific client will remain unchanged."

Brilliant...just brilliant stuff. Best game dev company
17/09/2021, 01:40 - Noone: Just had the whole "I know you" intimidation from some drug dealer
17/09/2021, 01:40 - Noone: The adrenaline still hasn't worn off, I'm shaking
17/09/2021, 01:41 - Noone: God I feel so in tune with the streets. I gave him my wallet and keys as a courtesy of course

17/09/2021, 08:28 - Mike: I know you intimidation? Like he was asking for something?
17/09/2021, 08:29 - Noone: "ah mate I know you from somewhere... You know me, we went to school together, I know I know you"
17/09/2021, 08:31 - Paul: To be fair i know you so it checks out
17/09/2021, 08:34 - Wezz: You didn't recognise me? I was out slanging on a Thursday
17/09/2021, 08:34 - Mike: Feeling out how much of a pushover you were then, I hope you raised your arms to appear larger
17/09/2021, 08:40 - Mike: Fucking Shiva Inu being listed on coinbase, can these fuck coins fuck off

17/09/2021, 12:33 - Lee: What kind of cheese?
17/09/2021, 12:33 - Lee: Like a hard cheese?
17/09/2021, 12:33 - Lee: Parmesan?
17/09/2021, 12:38 - Wezz: Gotta be a dairylea triangle
17/09/2021, 12:39 - Wezz: Wouldn't describe it as "sprinkling"
17/09/2021, 12:44 - James: I'm imagining grating a nice cheddar into it, melts it into a nice flavour lump at the bottom of the cup
17/09/2021, 12:45 - Paul: This is why you aren't in charge
17/09/2021, 13:17 - Mike: Bingo, grated

17/09/2021, 15:59 - Noone: Theyve also turned women into bowls of fruit
17/09/2021, 16:22 - Qck: Loved this one, yeah they've really drank the kool-aid hoping we'll forget about their ponytail management getting handsy
17/09/2021, 16:30 - Noone: Ponytail management rofl
17/09/2021, 17:38 - Wezz: Had to Google this. Jesus.

Imagine getting to work and being told "today we're going to remove all the blacks from our code" and feeling happy about what you do for a living.
17/09/2021, 17:38 - Wezz: Did they remove the term Whitelist?
17/09/2021, 17:39 - James: They changed it to crackerlist
17/09/2021, 17:39 - Wezz: Fixing racism one line at a time.
17/09/2021, 17:59 - Paul: racism is a myth started by George Washington to scare away the English
17/09/2021, 18:16 - Dayle: I have documentation section about not allowed terms fun fun love an allow list

18/09/2021, 08:42 - Lee: What's the story?
18/09/2021, 08:54 - Mike: Think we had 60 on one hand, then 20 spread on the top 3 side bets.

 Every. Single. Bet. Came. In.
18/09/2021, 08:55 - Mike: Trip 5s
18/09/2021, 09:57 - Lee: That's bonkers.
18/09/2021, 11:33 - Paul: More like grip hives

18/09/2021, 12:57 - Wezz: No Google's.

What has more iron in it, a Weetabix or a pint of Guinness?

18/09/2021, 13:21 - Dayle: Gonna be playing valhiem at 2 if anyone wants
18/09/2021, 13:25 - Mike: Guinness
18/09/2021, 13:25 - Nathan: Surely x1 guinnes has more than x1 wheetabix
18/09/2021, 13:27 - Wezz: I thought that too. Common misconception that Guinness has high iron content.

The truth is that Guinness contains around 0.3mg of iron per pint.
1 single Weetabix contains 2.25g iron.
18/09/2021, 13:27 - Wezz: Weetabix op
18/09/2021, 13:28 - Dayle: Eat to many weekabix your poo turns into a gurder
18/09/2021, 13:29 - Lockers: No new biomes yet?
18/09/2021, 13:30 - Dayle: Not sure just gonna test out the new hearth and home update
18/09/2021, 13:31 - Nathan: New balance patch as opposed to too much content to make things more stable for future content additions I belive
18/09/2021, 13:32 - Nathan: (New design/base building stuff though)
18/09/2021, 13:32 - Dayle: Oo nice
18/09/2021, 13:33 - Paul: Classic Derren post right after someone to derail

18/09/2021, 17:01 - Mike: So I just realised, I fucked up my day 2 PCR test and forgot to swab up my nose. Still got a negative result, wonder how many people have been doing that on purpose
18/09/2021, 17:04 - Mike: Also don't tell Boris guys
18/09/2021, 17:09 - Paul: How do you forget to do the worst part I call bullshit
18/09/2021, 17:13 - Mike: Put it in my mouth, almost vomited and forgot
18/09/2021, 17:13 - Mike: Paid 50 quid for that false result too, gutted

18/09/2021, 17:41 - Paul: Aren't you vaccinated anyway? Can basically go anywhere and do anything if you've got a vax passport here
18/09/2021, 17:45 - Mike: I just picked up some more today, will let you know
18/09/2021, 17:45 - Mike: Yeh but you can still contract and spread
18/09/2021, 18:01 - Paul: Yeah I know but if everyone allowed in is vaccinated you're reducing that risk massively any way
18/09/2021, 18:02 - Mike: Yeh goes without saying, this whole testing shit has just become a massive cash grab now imo. Need to ditch it asap
18/09/2021, 18:02 - Paul: I'd like to hope it's not privatised is it?
18/09/2021, 18:10 - Derren: https://www.bmj.com/content/373/bmj.n1514

19/09/2021, 12:49 - James: Suck it, cats
19/09/2021, 13:22 - Paul: fun fact, I once saw James dig wax out of his ear, move his finger towards his mouth, then he saw I was watching, winked at me and said "every little helps" and sucked his finger
19/09/2021, 13:23 - James: that earwax's name? albert waxstein
19/09/2021, 13:46 - Noone: I beleived every word up until you claimed James "winked". He has no control over his occular functions, be that control of his eyeballs or the movement of his eyelids. He spent 3 months involuntarily crosseyed.
19/09/2021, 13:52 - James: I also can't control my sideways lizard eyelids independently
19/09/2021, 13:54 - Paul: I know what I saw...

20/09/2021, 13:36 - Alex: A mom in the police is worth two in the neighbourhood watch?
20/09/2021, 13:36 - James: A hand in the mom is worth two in her bush?
20/09/2021, 14:03 - Derren: You were wrong about trusting your mate and trying to vote for his team üò≥
20/09/2021, 14:21 - James: Is trusting a friend wrong? Surely the scammer was in the wrong for stealing. I can't believe you'd resort to victim blaming Derren. I thought this was a safe space

20/09/2021, 14:25 - Derren: Typical white privledge
20/09/2021, 14:25 - James: A boob tube and miniskirt, but I don't see how that's relevant
20/09/2021, 14:26 - James: So you're just going to assume my race? I don't identify as white thank you very much bigot
20/09/2021, 14:33 - Paul: Typical

21/09/2021, 09:23 - Wezz: Is this like when we walk around the cloth seven times? Or more like when we treat women as second class citizens?
21/09/2021, 09:27 - Wezz: Which one are we okay with again? It's the women thing right? I'm easily confused.

22/09/2021, 22:36 - Lockers: Nah
22/09/2021, 22:38 - Paul: They definitely skirt the issue that it's the fault of our disgusting capitalism at its core. But I'll let them off

23/09/2021, 10:47 - Dayle: DONK
23/09/2021, 11:32 - James: Good donk
23/09/2021, 11:54 - Qck: Sorry what's the feces to shower ratio here
23/09/2021, 11:57 - Wezz: One roll = two shits.
Two shits = 0.25 showers.
0.01 shower = 3 dogecoin
100 dogecoin = one deliveroo code
23/09/2021, 12:05 - Qck: 8 shits before your asshole gets seen to is the only math I'm seeing
23/09/2021, 12:05 - Qck: Awful but lawful
23/09/2021, 12:17 - James: Three deliveroo codes per shower? How are you having so many takeaways every shower?
23/09/2021, 12:18 - Wezz: My asshole gets a good seeing to most nights mate don't you worry.
23/09/2021, 12:19 - Dayle: Shit, I can't see my dick let alone my arse hole
23/09/2021, 12:19 - Paul: Every little helps üòâ - James

23/09/2021, 12:27 - Paul: Wezz why is covid a political issue?
23/09/2021, 12:33 - Wezz: Without watching the latest Russel Brand video or using Google. I'm going to summarise as:
COVID has caused a lot of suffering. Suffering engages a desire for change. Politics is the act of making decisions within large groups. Bingo bango bongo.
23/09/2021, 12:35 - Paul: This is a bit reductionist don't you think? I need you to explain it far more extensively
23/09/2021, 12:35 - Wezz: Well my original explanation was:
Bingo bango bongo.
23/09/2021, 12:35 - Paul: Hmm I dunno sounds like trumps fault to me
23/09/2021, 12:37 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
23/09/2021, 12:37 - Paul: Oh my mistake sorry
23/09/2021, 12:40 - Wezz: Easy mistake to make. Have you tried absolving yourself of responsibility? A++ would recommend.
23/09/2021, 12:43 - Paul: Wezz why do most covid and vaccine conspiracies seem to come from the right when the left are if anything more untrusting of corporations and big pharma
23/09/2021, 12:47 - Wezz: I usually blame something complex beyond my control. It makes me feel better instantly, vindicates. E.g. Obama, The Government, or Capitalism
23/09/2021, 12:49 - Paul: Hmm sounds exhausting
23/09/2021, 12:49 - James: It is
23/09/2021, 12:49 - Paul: Much better to just blame people you see doing things directly
23/09/2021, 12:50 - Paul: The Jews for example
23/09/2021, 12:55 - Wezz: The funny thing is, once you get really good at it you barely notice it happening. Who wants to continually feel responsible for bad in the world y'know? As long as you hold onto those privileges and blame the strata above, things just seem, better?
23/09/2021, 12:58 - Paul: Yeah I know right? Gotta hide from that individual guilt that we totally should be feeling as we all collectively fucked up. We are all in this together.  Hierarchy is totally just a concept after all
23/09/2021, 13:01 - Qck: Because the right are retarded racist idiot fucks
23/09/2021, 13:01 - Paul: You're names not Wezz! Wait... or is it? Nathan help me out
23/09/2021, 13:01 - Paul: You're names
23/09/2021, 13:01 - Paul: You're
23/09/2021, 13:01 - Qck: Ooooh nooooo
23/09/2021, 13:01 - Paul: Fucking IDIOT
23/09/2021, 13:05 - Wezz: Precisely, you've got it! And blaming an innominate and inevitable hierarchical structure communicates that I'm in solidarity with the impoverished, which helps absolve me of my personal guilt, all while maintaining my privileges in the existing system.
It's all quite genius if I do say so myself.
23/09/2021, 13:07 - Paul: Of course the alternative would be madness. After all it's all just for show anyway. People aren't good. They are all cynical like me deep down and do it for some creepy identity game.
23/09/2021, 13:08 - Paul: No one actually genuinely cares lmao
23/09/2021, 13:10 - Paul: It's all about that self absolution. I've figured it all out
23/09/2021, 13:18 - Wezz: Nono, I really care, I know I do. But it's just, the good I'm truly capable of, can get stuck behind my detest and fear of a higher power. My internal battles of procrastination and realising my own potential are far more challenging than I originally expected - they can lead to feelings of helplessness. At times I need something to alleviate those personal pressures, not dissimilar to how religion helps those in need through tough times. My copeism is scapegoat capitalism.
23/09/2021, 13:19 - Wezz: (I'm quite enjoying this roleplay üòÇ)
23/09/2021, 13:19 - Nathan: <Media omitted>
23/09/2021, 13:19 - Paul: Well said kirky
23/09/2021, 13:20 - Kirky: Yea well done kirky youre really smart and amazing
23/09/2021, 13:20 - Wezz: Where's Wezz when you need him, he'd have some nonsense to add
23/09/2021, 13:20 - Kirky: Probably making a cake
23/09/2021, 13:23 - Wezz: You're but thanks
23/09/2021, 13:24 - Paul: Exactly. Criticising things, wishing for better, discussing alternatives and supporting alternatives are all just projection at the end of the day. It's like I said, I'm a cynic at heart. So I know everyone else is motivated by those same narratives. If I couldn't possibly genuinely believe in them then no one could. The unfortunate reality is that everyone else is just a bit naive, you know? They are looking for vices to get out of their bubbles. Ways to relate to one another. I just genuinely cannot comprehend that people could philosophize and critique our problems without having some personal subconscious agenda
23/09/2021, 13:25 - Kirky: Sorry im at work in my NHS office and and the keyboard is broken
23/09/2021, 13:25 - Kirky: Underfunded public sectors for you
23/09/2021, 13:25 - Wezz: Hah, I can relate you retard no problem
23/09/2021, 13:30 - Wezz: Wait, that's not true. Discussion and freedom of speech are integral for progression on either side of the fence. Well, immersion ruined. You just stayed with the same 'incompassionate' point and massively straw manned it loool.
23/09/2021, 13:32 - Wezz: I like that you called out the projection of their character on their worldview though. It's a valid point, and a nice way to slip in some ad hominem.
23/09/2021, 13:33 - Mike: Has anyone ever tried turning the economy off and on again?
23/09/2021, 13:33 - Mike: Same goes for climate change probably
23/09/2021, 13:34 - Wezz: You told us you'd fixed that on Monday?!
23/09/2021, 13:35 - Paul: As if the procrastination and feelings of helplessness weren't ad hominem? Don't pretend I introduced that lol
23/09/2021, 13:36 - Wezz: I think they're very normal feelings that everyone (with a brain) endures.
23/09/2021, 13:38 - Mike: Yeh the tree hasnt grown yet, apparently it takes a long time and I don't really have time for that
23/09/2021, 13:41 - Paul: But how is me staying on the same point any different from what you did in your last reply? I don't get it. You did the exact same thing
23/09/2021, 13:50 - Wezz: Lol. I was trying to play you as a moderate left, expecting you to play me anywhere near the center. With the hope we could agree in some lovely epiphany at the end. Instead, you went mad right-wing incel and I only have 10 minutes until my training starts. Spending it digging out of a
23/09/2021, 13:51 - Wezz: ...obviously incorrect perspective is meh üòÇ
23/09/2021, 13:54 - Paul: I wasn't really playing you tbf
23/09/2021, 13:54 - Paul: I was just being sarcy
23/09/2021, 13:55 - Wezz: The edges (particularly far right) is so obviously incorrect it banes talking about. The juicy stuff is in the middle - I also like talking far left ideologues since they're not spoken about enough in recent times.
23/09/2021, 13:58 - Paul: I think you were playing a different game to me. I was just acting as someone on the right vs someone on the left. I wasn't doing a me vs you lol
23/09/2021, 13:59 - Wezz: Far right it's obvious; Hitler, racism, fascism.
Far left is like; Lenin/Stalin/Mao, identity politics, equity?

Not quite as emotionally compelling to most people
23/09/2021, 14:00 - Paul: Both sides have identity politics let's be fair
23/09/2021, 14:00 - Wezz: Yeah mb, wrong word choice
23/09/2021, 14:02 - Paul: I think that far left is super interesting. I've never argued more than I do with fellow leftists. It's just a constant debate. Which is very enriching but also super unproductive
23/09/2021, 14:02 - Paul: I can't talk for the far right. I don't know if they disagree as much as the left or not.
23/09/2021, 14:03 - Wezz: I enjoyed it anyways. Same logic behind debating for something you don't necessary believe. Forces you to consider the individual, what validates their beliefs etc.
23/09/2021, 14:04 - Paul: Anyone that disagrees with me is a moron cunt
23/09/2021, 14:10 - Wezz: Sure, I experience the same talking with moderates of any kind. But if you get to the ACTUAL far left, it's very much houseshoe theory supporting. E.g. controlling speech because it can cause offence.
23/09/2021, 14:11 - Wezz: And I find the unproductivity is a symptom of attempting the impossible task of equity (equality of outcome).
23/09/2021, 14:11 - Paul: It's really not. I read a lot about it. It's very much a complex debate. A Marxist lecturer I like told a story of how a colleague once threw a copy of das capital at him and asked if he'd even read it
23/09/2021, 14:12 - Paul: And that's amongst the scholars lol
23/09/2021, 14:13 - Paul: You'll definitely encounter groups like that. But there's a reason there are 50 different titles for every different facet. Whether you're a Marxist Leninist or a Leninist Marxist or a Bakunin Anarchist
23/09/2021, 14:13 - Paul: So much in fighting it's insane
23/09/2021, 14:14 - Paul: I mean take one look at Trotsky. It's always been like that
23/09/2021, 14:39 - Wezz: Yeah, I know so little RE the various strands of communist ideologies. I hear of loads, just tend to put the situation in the same basket as I do for the splintering of religious groups e.g. Christianity. I guess I've not met someone who has offered a proper alternative, they just spend their time hating on hierarchies which is fine, but then when discussing _why_ they exist their conclusion blames capitalism. It's like, hierarchies are inevitable for society to function.

So after I ignore some key realities in the interest of progressing discussion beyond 'capitalism is bad', we then get to enjoy debating various fixes of inequality. And that's my absolute favourite bit. I love hypothetically fixing all these things. Even though in the back of my head I find it kinda self-indulgent since we've already agreed to operate outside the realms of reality. It's still helpful. Then trying to bring those discussions into something feasible is the end goal, by that point, we're 4 pints deep and everyone knows feasibility is boring so we talk about the Spice Girls instead.
23/09/2021, 14:41 - Paul: I don't think anyone really thinks capitalism is bad is a valid argument. It's just a meme (true meme)
23/09/2021, 14:44 - Paul: But fundamentally it's pretty easy to see the how the thinking evolves. Capitalism is growth driven. We're running out of ways it can expand freely. Late stage capitalism means that money rules everything. Capital is the driving force of will and chooses the direction we go in. Rather than anything rational or helpful. Those are the only real points that are strongly agreed upon on the left. Everything else is a free for all
23/09/2021, 14:46 - Paul: Anarchosyndicalism vs mutualism for example. They spring up from the same premise but have a huge chasm between them for solutions
23/09/2021, 14:47 - Paul: It's a science as much as it is a belief system. I think you do it a discredit to refer to the theories in a similar vein to religion
23/09/2021, 15:07 - Mike: <Media omitted>
23/09/2021, 15:07 - Derren: Noob
23/09/2021, 15:07 - Dayle: That's a markdown table :o
23/09/2021, 15:08 - Dayle: Wtf though
23/09/2021, 15:14 - Mike: Regex, just string matching. Never heard of a fucking emdash so this wasted a lot of my life
23/09/2021, 15:14 - Mike: Explain each type of dash
23/09/2021, 15:14 - Wezz: Well, without proper feasibility it very much _is_ a belief system. But sure, I get your point.

Late-stage capitalism is totally dismal and interesting, especially now we're in unprecedented international times. With "¬£¬£ being the driving force of will", it constantly needs addressing, e.g. essentials available to individuals to avoid archaic levels of desperation. That's what the world has always tried to keep in balance, the rich keeping the poor content enough that they don't riot.

I think I put too much faith in morality prevailing.

If I'm Bezos, you don't think I turn some humanitarian corner in the later years of my life and fix the world's problems? I let the people around my rocketship starve to the point that they throw their malnourished bodies at me? It's a weird one. Ofc it's unreliable. But it's quite a feasible dystopian development of the current 'conscience marketing' trend.

We'd all shop at Amazon until they were the only company left on earth. They'd get one of those Call of Duty prestige badges and then we'd start again. I mean... Monopoly was a warning right?
23/09/2021, 15:17 - Paul: It's funny because usually the utopian revolutionary is the more hopeful and optimistic but I have 0 faith in Jeff fucking Bezos to safe the world while he's actively exploiting it with impunity
23/09/2021, 15:18 - Paul: Even if he turns over a new leaf in his dying years he can't really undo the damage has perpetuated
23/09/2021, 15:18 - Paul: He's*
23/09/2021, 15:22 - Wezz: Well, I'm hoping his relationship with his 4 children has suffered considerably as a result of his business endeavours.

So either;
1. His resentment for them will encourage a large charitable donation on his death bed
2. Their resentment for him will encourage them to go against his selfish will post mortem

Ever the optimist üòé
23/09/2021, 15:24 - Paul: That's what we've come to as a society. Relying on Jeff Bezos' family collapsing to save the whales
23/09/2021, 15:24 - James: Well, the emdash is the middle one, used for starting a list. The smallest is the esdash, which hyphenates words, and then the eldash is for establishing dominance against the lower underscores
23/09/2021, 15:24 - James: If you're really trying hard you can also make an exeldash
23/09/2021, 15:25 - James: or an exexeldash

23/09/2021, 15:28 - Wezz: I thought it was the Japanese killing the whales? There you go, scapegoating again
23/09/2021, 15:30 - James: I've been playing a really interesting documentary called Dishonored, and its actually the middle class that are promoting whale killing for their meat and oil

26/09/2021, 11:31 - Wezz: Usyk / AJ rematch was on even if AJ won?

Does that mean we now get AJ invoking rematch. Then if he wins we get usyk invoking after? My dreams of AJ Fury for all the gold is min 2 matches away?

26/09/2021, 11:33 - Lockers: Same thing happened with fury wilder kinda
26/09/2021, 11:33 - Wezz: Unless usyk wins next fight. And then AJ goes beltless to the US to lose to fury
26/09/2021, 11:33 - Lockers: +1 no other option
26/09/2021, 11:34 - Lockers: Oh sorry yeah that too. Can't see it happening though

26/09/2021, 11:44 - Lockers: Julia's mindset I guess
26/09/2021, 11:44 - Paul: But honestly since switching to oat milk the colours are way darker or at least harder to keep co consistent
26/09/2021, 11:45 - Paul: I think there's a healthy mix of "could be worse" in there too

03/10/2021, 12:50 - Wezz: This is early onset psychosis
03/10/2021, 12:54 - James: I mean, she's with Alex so we could  have guessed that

03/10/2021, 22:30 - Kirky: Yea hopefully
03/10/2021, 22:30 - Kirky: Cant wait for someone to get killed and forgotten about over it

04/10/2021, 14:23 - Paul: I thought they were infinity symbols at first but now I'm not sure
04/10/2021, 14:26 - Paul: Never mind I've found it
04/10/2021, 14:39 - James: They're burglar masks, they signify that the remainder is stolen and given to the poor
04/10/2021, 15:15 - Dayle: Fuck off Paul üòÇüòÇüòÇ
04/10/2021, 15:36 - Paul: Thought maybe someone of the comp sci guys would know
04/10/2021, 15:38 - Mike: they are infinite symbols, never seen one with an underscore before it
04/10/2021, 15:39 - Paul: Yeah it's cool I got it
04/10/2021, 15:39 - James: What are they then?
04/10/2021, 15:39 - Mike: whats it mean? -infinity to positive infinity integration?
04/10/2021, 15:39 - Paul: Exactly
04/10/2021, 15:40 - Paul: It's basically a completely meaningless addition that adds nothing other than to say "all possible data" which in the context just wasn't relevant
04/10/2021, 15:41 - Mike: Yeh didn't seem like something that required solving, soon as infinity gets involved I stop reading
04/10/2021, 15:42 - Paul: It's just dummy coding really. Not to tricky when you know the variables
04/10/2021, 15:42 - Paul: Too*

04/10/2021, 22:44 - Kirky: IS IT BACK
04/10/2021, 22:44 - Wezz: Haven't see the integral symbol since uni...would have guessed same as you negative infin to positive infin.

Looks like they've used an em dash instead of the usual minus sign/hyphen that you'd use in math. Not to bring back oppressed memories @447943624891
04/10/2021, 22:44 - Wezz: WhatsApp and Facebook down? @4:48pm?

05/10/2021, 22:57 - Paul: I have 0 hype for it which is a shame
05/10/2021, 23:33 - Mike: "S. Korea moving to introduce state-run health insurance for pets"
05/10/2021, 23:36 - Derren: Was expecting a post about how to not get your steam account stolen
06/10/2021, 08:04 - Lockers: Why
06/10/2021, 08:05 - Lockers: That'd be handy
06/10/2021, 09:22 - Paul: Because I know the story inevitably gods nowhere
06/10/2021, 09:22 - Paul: Goes
06/10/2021, 09:23 - Dayle: You're correct god is nowhere
06/10/2021, 09:23 - James: To be fair, any reference or stories around the gods also went nowhere
06/10/2021, 09:28 - Lockers: *everywhere

06/10/2021, 11:32 - James: Massive following
06/10/2021, 11:32 - James: Credited to making D&D more mainstream over the last few years

06/10/2021, 11:56 - Wezz: Not sure what it encompasses. But unlikely it'll include sponsorships or donations.
06/10/2021, 11:56 - Wezz: Likely just subs and contract $$
06/10/2021, 11:56 - Derren: It doesn't just what twitch pays them
06/10/2021, 11:57 - Wezz: Also pre tax obv
06/10/2021, 11:58 - Wezz: Yeah would make sense. Can't wait to see all the leaks... also vulnerabilities that come out of source being exposed
06/10/2021, 11:59 - Paul: quick unrelated question: when you guys swallow, do your ears click? Mine have always done it and I assumed everyones do
06/10/2021, 11:59 - Mike: "the I'd we generate is random, we manually add it to code though as seen here"
06/10/2021, 12:00 - Dayle: Haha
06/10/2021, 12:01 - Wezz: Yeah man! The old ear tube equalising. Normal I think (?)
06/10/2021, 12:01 - Wezz: God they're so gonna use that too... ü§¢
06/10/2021, 12:04 - Mike: I also hear it everytime
06/10/2021, 12:05 - Paul: ok goodüëç
06/10/2021, 12:10 - Derren: I can make mine click on demand too, very useful on trains and planes
06/10/2021, 12:12 - Paul: yeah same, i incorporate it into my teeth drumming
06/10/2021, 12:18 - Derren: bruh why would you do that
06/10/2021, 12:18 - Wezz: Well, now you've lost me.
06/10/2021, 12:18 - Derren: https://youtu.be/ivzQhF4kIXo
06/10/2021, 12:19 - Paul: @447850499652 can explain
06/10/2021, 12:19 - Derren: I can just make my ears do the clicking thing without doing anything else with my mouth etc, no movements required
06/10/2021, 12:20 - Paul: Yeah same
06/10/2021, 12:20 - Noone: Combination of moving spit around the tongue to make snare and hi hate noise and teeth for bass drum
06/10/2021, 12:21 - Noone: <Media omitted>
06/10/2021, 12:22 - Derren: Stop damaging your teeth lol
06/10/2021, 12:22 - James: Oh, yeah I do that, I'd never heard it called teeth drumming before
06/10/2021, 12:22 - James: To be fair, I'd never heard it discussed before
06/10/2021, 12:22 - Wezz: That's my blowing guys technique
06/10/2021, 12:23 - Noone: The ol' Chomp and spit
06/10/2021, 12:23 - Paul: I don't do it with spit. I have a certain incisor tooth thats the hi-hat as it sounds more high pitched, another for snare, another for bass
06/10/2021, 12:23 - James: I've always thought of it more like drumming with air pressure in your mouth, my teeth don't feel involved
06/10/2021, 12:23 - Paul: The ear clicks add some nice syncopation
06/10/2021, 12:24 - Noone: The right spit and tongue movements you can even get toms
06/10/2021, 12:25 - Paul: Yeah I think I might have done some permanent damage over the years, I've done it since I was a kid
06/10/2021, 12:27 - Paul: Ask me more about teeth drumming so I can avoid work
06/10/2021, 12:28 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
06/10/2021, 12:29 - Derren: Nooney might know it
06/10/2021, 12:31 - Derren: I'm curious of your guys opinions on bidets (whether inbuilt, separate unit or hand held) would you want one if you could have one in your house or do you not care much about it?
06/10/2021, 12:32 - Dayle: <Media omitted>
06/10/2021, 13:10 - James: I installed one in my house, cost about ¬£20 and took 10 mins to install. Would recommend.
06/10/2021, 13:12 - Derren: seat? Handheld? Little nipple in the toilet bowl?

06/10/2021, 13:15 - Dayle: Yeah I had somthing behind a plastered wall once - it was paul
06/10/2021, 13:15 - Paul: I could always drunkenly slam through that wall for you
06/10/2021, 13:15 - James: Looks invasive, like it's going to probe you
06/10/2021, 13:16 - Derren: You don't put it inside xD
06/10/2021, 13:16 - Derren: Just have the head spray at your ass

06/10/2021, 15:02 - Mike: Probably not, I'd have to assume they used encryption for your passwords. Even if their entire database of passwords get stolen, it's not useful to the hackers and they cannot log into your account with it.

06/10/2021, 15:03 - Kirky: alright nerd calm down
06/10/2021, 15:04 - Mike: Apparently the guy who leaked it all said it was because of Twitch's toxic community, are they referring to the twitch thots / twitch admin abuse / random community abuse / etc?
06/10/2021, 15:04 - Mike: I bet each community right now is like "yeh everyone else is toxic"
06/10/2021, 15:04 - Paul: Twitch is run by goat people
06/10/2021, 15:05 - Kirky: gonna assume random community abuse. they were talking about it on radio 1 the other day. interviewing streamers about 13 year olds typing rude words in their chat

06/10/2021, 15:06 - Mike: I'd assume selling gambling to kids is more toxic than dropping n bombs in a random streamers chay

07/10/2021, 08:46 - Wezz: At Waterloo, just got off the tube. No signal down there. Also, that would require careful forethought, not my usual state of mind pre-McDonalds.
07/10/2021, 10:03 - James: It's always funny when you're sat on mute in a meeting, and let out a fart, and teams is like "If you're trying to say something, you're muted"

07/10/2021, 11:01 - Derren: Unless I won then i'd leave with more than 10 quid
07/10/2021, 11:01 - Noone: you saucy devil
07/10/2021, 11:02 - Noone: my Dad in his retiremend discovered a way of cheating online betting places, he made like ¬£300 and has been effectively banned from all UK online betting
07/10/2021, 11:02 - Noone: I say discovered a way, he discovered a youtuber who shows you how to do it lol
07/10/2021, 11:02 - Derren: for 300 quid not worth xD
07/10/2021, 11:02 - Derren: The places I go to, you just have to write a name on a piece of paper for them to match the money, they didn't take any details from you at all

07/10/2021, 22:01 - Noone: James
07/10/2021, 22:02 - Noone: if it's power per weight then it's James, if it's flat out strongest animal despite weight or any other mechanical factor, it's James
07/10/2021, 22:05 - Paul: Ok so we've got James vs an Elephant so far
07/10/2021, 22:05 - Noone: yeah, a a James sized James and a James sized Elephant

07/10/2021, 22:07 - Noone: for power to weight

This is legit super interesting. These boys are born with vaginas and it slowly morphs into a penis when they hit puberty.

08/10/2021, 17:55 - Wezz: I'm just coming, alone, in my room, for his girl.

08/10/2021, 18:12 - Mike: Have you seen Sam? No one wants him hanging around during a party
08/10/2021, 18:13 - Lee: I would.
08/10/2021, 18:20 - Wezz: Mate, they don't know I'm turning up. I consider it a formal invitation for a threesome.
08/10/2021, 18:21 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
08/10/2021, 18:22 - Wezz: "Lush" isn't that a thing a northerner would say?

08/10/2021, 18:26 - Derren: Had a similar thing when I moved in to a new place 2 weeks ago, got a letter saying the kid was having a party and sorry for the noise etc
08/10/2021, 18:27 - Wezz: The day I trust Lockers in identifying 'things' is my last day of consciousness.
08/10/2021, 18:27 - Derren: Bunch of 16 year old celebrating getting their results and shit with alcohol was funny to watch, saw a kid passed out in a Bush
08/10/2021, 18:27 - Derren: Lots of crying and arguing
08/10/2021, 18:28 - Derren: Sweaty Sam

08/10/2021, 18:30 - Wezz: I'd say it's akin to attacking a man for the colour of their skin. I can't help my sweaty head

09/10/2021, 09:08 - Noone: Love watching videos of people drag those soy sipping "insulate Britain" faggots out of the street
09/10/2021, 09:08 - Noone: Imagine thinking that getting the entire country to HATE you will lead others to rally to your cause
09/10/2021, 09:16 - Derren: More so to get in headlines to raise awareness, like those guys that were standing on trains
09/10/2021, 09:41 - Noone: doesn't seem like a good strategy to get what you want, just focuses the country on fucking hating you lol
09/10/2021, 10:09 - James: Mike and I had a game last night with some edgy teenager that said his whore left him and he was going to kill himself, spend the entire game running into mid tower, then told everyone else KYS. Was banned by the time we finished the next game
09/10/2021, 10:33 - Paul: Stop dissing on soy bitch

09/10/2021, 11:36 - Mike: Then asked him what his whore would think if she could see him now
09/10/2021, 11:36 - Mike: Don't think that helped
09/10/2021, 11:36 - James: Nah man, I think you helped a lot. Have you considered becoming a therapist?
09/10/2021, 11:37 - Mike: Have you considered kys?
09/10/2021, 11:37 - James: Tempting...
09/10/2021, 11:37 - Noone: Considered becoming a the rapist

10/10/2021, 09:57 - Derren: This is what happens when you're overly invested in your job
10/10/2021, 09:57 - Derren: Time for a work life balance check boy
10/10/2021, 09:57 - Dayle: Life doesn't give you checks only work
10/10/2021, 09:58 - Noone: I woke up and panicked that I hadn't set an alarm so I rushed getting out without thinking I am very confused how it got this far but I'm getting free food from the office now

10/10/2021, 11:50 - Wezz: This is too funny. You must love your work man.

I reluctantly watch the news _every morning_ just on the off chance the world has collapsed and I don't have to go in for a day.
10/10/2021, 12:24 - Paul: Why can't my job be playing video games in my underwear?
10/10/2021, 12:28 - Derren: be a streamer
10/10/2021, 12:30 - Wezz: I've watched a streamer once. You're welcome
10/10/2021, 12:32 - Nathan: Sameeeeee!
10/10/2021, 12:51 - Kirky: it has been for 18 months for you WFH people hasnt it?
10/10/2021, 13:02 - Derren: Well I sit at my computer wrapped in a duvet during working hours playing games so I guess that means I get paid to play games
10/10/2021, 13:15 - Mike: Was pretty dope
10/10/2021, 13:16 - Lee: Best thing I've seen all year.
10/10/2021, 13:58 - Mike: Fight was good, dunno how Wilder kept going as he looked gassed from round 5.
10/10/2021, 13:59 - Lockers: Spoiler!!!!!
10/10/2021, 13:59 - Lockers: But yeah he looked fucked up early on
10/10/2021, 14:00 - Mike: That comment specifically no spoil, why you say dis
10/10/2021, 14:10 - Paul: No I don't want to interact with random people and be entertaining. I want to spill Doritos dip down myself and not shower for 3 days while I silently play games and occasionally masturbate when I can finally be bothered and sit in post nut clarity staring at my monitor closing 25 pornhub tabs
10/10/2021, 14:13 - Paul: Hey man I had to get out of my chair and go to the door and clap for a whole minute once a week. Spare a thought for me too
10/10/2021, 14:26 - James: Implying you're not in incognito mode and close the whole window. I don't want to reflect on what I've just watched

11/10/2021, 17:19 - Kirky: 100% agree with this one above all the others

11/10/2021, 17:29 - Nathan: Not a clue which Sam is Sam. Can the _real_ Sam please stand up?
11/10/2021, 17:48 - Lockers: Why
11/10/2021, 17:49 - Wezz: Alex is a domesticated cat.

11/10/2021, 18:16 - Paul: Is this more on the owl side or the orangutan?
11/10/2021, 18:17 - Qck: Owl, your head is on a swivel looking for the little boys as you use your swimming pedigree to luke skywalker your way into their piss pipe
11/10/2021, 18:18 - Lockers: This is the perfect description for Paul
11/10/2021, 18:36 - Paul: Ah yeah I see it now. That really is me

11/10/2021, 19:08 - Derren: When can we expect a vid of you doing this
11/10/2021, 19:09 - Wezz: Not another fucking Tom 'White British' Scott video... ffs Misto
11/10/2021, 19:11 - Kirky: basically a dock near a mcdonalds, very disapointing
11/10/2021, 19:12 - Kirky: literally pubs near me thatll bring you a pint to you in a canoe, wheres their video
11/10/2021, 19:12 - Mike: Hey :(

11/10/2021, 19:19 - Derren: ü•≥
11/10/2021, 19:34 - Paul: This is like 600km from where I live
11/10/2021, 19:34 - Derren: Easy walk
11/10/2021, 20:23 - Noone: My favourite animation
11/10/2021, 20:28 - Dayle: <Media omitted>
11/10/2021, 21:21 - Mike: <Media omitted>
11/10/2021, 21:25 - Wezz: Two cans? As far as I know, Monster only comes in 500ml cans. Did they boil down a litre into ~300ml of sludge? Serving suggestion is just, "maybe you'll want to put it in a bowl?"
11/10/2021, 21:26 - Wezz: Gonna Popeye that right down my lughole
11/10/2021, 21:26 - Wezz: Wait, lughole's an ear...
11/10/2021, 21:26 - Wezz: All the Monster's rotted my brain
11/10/2021, 21:57 - Noone: <Media omitted>
11/10/2021, 21:59 - Noone: Off to York tomorrow to interview a bunch of students for their Year in Industry 2022. What questions should I ask them?
11/10/2021, 21:59 - Wezz: If you could be any animal
11/10/2021, 22:00 - Noone: "If you could be any animal?"
"You're asking me if I can *be* any animal? No I can't, I'm just a person?"
11/10/2021, 22:01 - Noone: serious answers only
11/10/2021, 22:03 - Mike: Given that God is infinite and that the folly of man knows no bounds, could God be just one of our follys?
11/10/2021, 22:04 - Nathan: Would you eat ethically sourced human meat if it was an option.
11/10/2021, 22:04 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
11/10/2021, 22:06 - Wezz: 'ethically sourced' nudge nudge wink wink
11/10/2021, 22:06 - Derren: üòÇ
11/10/2021, 22:06 - Wezz: (you have to do the nudge nudge wink wink)
11/10/2021, 22:07 - Paul: How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
11/10/2021, 22:07 - Lockers: 4
11/10/2021, 22:15 - Noone: Thanks Nathan first serious answer
11/10/2021, 22:16 - Kirky: What are your thoughts on fixing the jew problem
11/10/2021, 22:17 - Noone: True
11/10/2021, 22:26 - Derren: How do you reverse male pattern baldness
11/10/2021, 22:28 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
11/10/2021, 22:29 - Noone: the solution is to rub the blood of a turk into your scalp
11/10/2021, 22:31 - Wezz: Is Paul all three objects? Who owns the yellow ball? Is Pink Paul the real Paul? (I think so)

Appreciate your help
11/10/2021, 22:37 - Derren: üò¢
11/10/2021, 22:37 - Noone: Appreciate your scelp
11/10/2021, 22:38 - James: "Can you lick my elbow?"

12/10/2021, 18:28 - Kirky: Baking class tonight üëå
12/10/2021, 18:31 - Nathan: Oh cool teaching some degenerate kids the way of a master bake!
12/10/2021, 18:36 - Kirky: Yea you know me, the one and only Sam Wezz. Love baking üëå
12/10/2021, 18:53 - Lee: Is The Great British Bake Off your favourite TV show?
12/10/2021, 19:04 - Wezz: It's mine too
12/10/2021, 19:04 - Wezz: https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/game-updates/disabling-all-chat/
@447943624891, you were right all along
12/10/2021, 19:14 - Wezz: Can someone tell me why Riot would force disable all chat in League.... blows my mind how out of touch they are lool. You can literally turn it off in options. It's DEFAULTED to off on new accounts. But nope, no more all chat in games GG EZ
12/10/2021, 19:16 - Wezz: i got shit work stuff to do, be about tomorrow night hopefully
12/10/2021, 19:18 - Qck: Uninstalled
12/10/2021, 19:18 - Kirky: HOW IS CYBER BULLYING REAL NIGGA
12/10/2021, 19:20 - Mike: Should be auto off then switch on in options
12/10/2021, 19:20 - Wezz: That's literally what it is already.
12/10/2021, 19:20 - Mike: Actually tbf bet 90 percent of reports come from all chat
12/10/2021, 19:20 - Wezz: They've decided to cut All Chat entirely.
12/10/2021, 19:20 - Mike: Disabled for all
12/10/2021, 19:20 - Wezz: Only after the game can you chat to enemies
12/10/2021, 19:22 - Qck: You're going to see the most spiteful evil shit in that condensed after-game moment
12/10/2021, 19:23 - Wezz: spend 30 minutes writing my anger into a notepad file to copy and paste in the end game lobby
12/10/2021, 19:34 - Kirky: I miss screaming at the enemy team over the mics in cs at half time
12/10/2021, 19:36 - Paul: Probably saves them a lot of effort adding swear words to their filter made by an intern
12/10/2021, 19:36 - Kirky: Yea people gonna have messages copied ready to paste as soon as it ends
12/10/2021, 19:39 - Paul: https://youtu.be/b4pUfFh4pMs best one imo
12/10/2021, 19:40 - Kirky: Probably shouldn't open that in class I guess
12/10/2021, 19:41 - Paul: I guess
12/10/2021, 22:08 - Kirky: üòÇüòÇüëå
12/10/2021, 22:10 - Lockers: Always took my headphones off at halftime
12/10/2021, 22:39 - Paul: Did you know that the chemical Alex Jones was ranting about that turns the frogs gay is also associated with the incidence rate of boys born with micropenises
12/10/2021, 23:07 - Noone: It actually turns frogs gay
12/10/2021, 23:08 - Paul: Nah not gay but can make them develop female traits and become hermaphroditic
12/10/2021, 23:09 - Mike: That's gay bro
12/10/2021, 23:10 - Paul: Lol yeah right next you'll tell me it's gay to give a made a brojob
12/10/2021, 23:10 - Paul: Mate*
12/10/2021, 23:11 - Mike: If it wasn't gay in ancient Greece it's not gay now
12/10/2021, 23:13 - Paul: Choo choo
13/10/2021, 09:40 - Paul: What would you guys say is the difference between a shitposter and a troll? Just saw a guy say he used to be both but he's no longer a troll and I thought that is simultaneously very self reflective and also incredibly sad to be so invested in those categories to be able to differentiate the behaviours so clearly
13/10/2021, 09:41 - Paul: Like surely they mostly overlap
13/10/2021, 09:48 - James: I think a shitposter doesn't necessarily care about annoying people specifically, where as a troll feeds from the anger of others.
13/10/2021, 09:49 - Paul: So Jack Noone is a troll and Sam Williams is a shitposter?
13/10/2021, 09:49 - James: Yeah, I think they cross into both sometimes, but normally they will fit those categories.
13/10/2021, 09:50 - Lockers: Depends on the topics
13/10/2021, 09:55 - Mike: Not sure distinguishing between them is useful but is guess Shitposter just posts low quality content, i.e. dropping meme jokes in /r/science. Troll purposefully posts provoking content to make people angry?
13/10/2021, 09:58 - Paul: Well it's not remotely useful lol I was just curious of opinions. Wouldn't in your first example it really then depend on the motives of the person posting shitty memes? Can you infer if something is a troll or a shitpost without the context of why they posted it? In a vacuum? (I'm bored)
13/10/2021, 09:58 - Paul: E.g. you can shitpost as a method of trolling
13/10/2021, 09:59 - James: Yeah, but it depends where, and to who. If you argued vehemently something antivax in a science discussion and don't believe it yourself, you're trolling because you knew it would annoy them.
13/10/2021, 10:00 - James: If you had the same discussion and posted about  ducks having a secret ruling class, it's still nonsense but not inflammatory nonsense
13/10/2021, 10:01 - Paul: I guess then it's about the trolling art of attempting to blur those lines without people noticing
13/10/2021, 10:02 - Paul: Where do Derren's forwards from grandma fit into all this?
13/10/2021, 10:02 - Mike: well they say intent is 98 tenths of the law
13/10/2021, 10:21 - Wezz: There's a venn diagram here.  As Mike said, Trolling definitely fits *provoking*. If you're not provoking you're not trolling. Whereas shit posting is usually just of low quality e.g. with little regard of etiquette.
13/10/2021, 10:26 - Mike: Oh here he comes with his Venn diagrams again
13/10/2021, 10:27 - Dayle: Venn is he going to stop that shit
13/10/2021, 11:33 - Kirky: <Media omitted>
13/10/2021, 11:33 - Kirky: Have I woken up in America
13/10/2021, 11:38 - Mike: Burn their mail
13/10/2021, 11:39 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
13/10/2021, 11:39 - Wezz: Leave me alone Jeffrey
13/10/2021, 12:27 - Paul: Right but can you, as a neutral spectator, distinguish between the two without additional knowledge of intent?
13/10/2021, 12:27 - Paul: I don't think it's about provocation. I think it's specifically about intent. Innocuous and irrelevant crap memes can provoke people without intention to upset them for example.
13/10/2021, 12:30 - Derren: Always knew you were gay
13/10/2021, 12:31 - James: "Look, let's get down to brass tacks, you like nakedness, I don't wear clothes, send me money on Venmo"
13/10/2021, 12:45 - Nathan: It's been 15 minutes now, if you don't use Venmo I also take CashApp, Monzo & Bitcoin
13/10/2021, 16:26 - Qck: Pretty sure every reddit comment is categorised under shitpost
13/10/2021, 18:08 - Mike: Ok we had animals
13/10/2021, 18:09 - Mike: Now, what Simpson character is everyone? I vote Wezz for Krusty the Klown
13/10/2021, 18:10 - Qck: Paul is Milhouse
13/10/2021, 18:10 - James: I vote Mike as Old Gil
13/10/2021, 18:11 - Mike: Not even young Gil?
13/10/2021, 18:12 - Mike: *Paul's voice* "But why did I have the bowl Mike? Why did I have the BOWL?"
13/10/2021, 18:12 - James: Come on Mikey, don't make me do this in front of everyone
13/10/2021, 18:13 - Qck: I vote you as Professor Frink
13/10/2021, 18:13 - James: Oh boy oh gloiven, with the dungeons, and the dragons, and the OH MERCY DIMBLE DONG
13/10/2021, 18:14 - Qck: Noone for Nelson, before I get lumped with him
13/10/2021, 18:14 - Qck: That's it
13/10/2021, 18:15 - Mike: You can't take this from me, my wifes going to leave me if I don't start bringing in the green PLEASE
13/10/2021, 18:17 - Mike: Noone is clearly Bart what with the skateboarding and what not
13/10/2021, 18:17 - Mike: Also his inability to read
13/10/2021, 18:18 - Mike: Nathan is Santa's Little Helper
13/10/2021, 18:21 - Nathan: Dayle = Willy
13/10/2021, 18:22 - Nathan: I mean a reoccurring character at least so I'll take it ü§£
13/10/2021, 18:22 - James: Alex is Sideshow bob
13/10/2021, 18:22 - Qck: Then I'm clearly Maggie
13/10/2021, 18:27 - Lockers: Because you still wear nappies?
13/10/2021, 18:28 - James: Because he SUCKS HAHAHAH
13/10/2021, 18:36 - Qck: Because of my ongoing feud with that monobrow baby
13/10/2021, 18:36 - Qck: Derren Apu
13/10/2021, 18:36 - Qck: Cya Derren
13/10/2021, 18:37 - Wezz: I know this is old news now... but yeah in some situations you can. Obvious troll is obvious - and if the post is of high quality, that's your distinction without known intent. But yeah, mostly need to know intent. A lot of people going around getting triggered by people just spouting nonsense for fun, it's why I like shitposting here, just taking my free speech for a spin blab some drivel and close my phone
13/10/2021, 18:38 - Qck: Wezz is Professor Frink
13/10/2021, 18:38 - Wezz: See, this is obvious Troll
13/10/2021, 18:40 - Wezz: A shitpost would be Derren is Dr Hibbert... or Cleveland Brown. Just isn't provoking enough
13/10/2021, 18:40 - Wezz: Or even relevant to The Simpsons.
13/10/2021, 18:41 - Mike: No, he is Krusty and thats final
13/10/2021, 18:42 - Mike: His rejection of his Jewish family is what seals the deal
13/10/2021, 18:44 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
13/10/2021, 18:50 - Noone: this is how I want every video to be https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQBQ2u876h0&ab_channel=Deoxide
13/10/2021, 18:53 - Wezz: Everytime I watch a video you link, I wonder if this is what it feels like to have ADHD.
13/10/2021, 20:18 - Qck: In contrast he spent most of LAN watching car videos that require you to have the opposite of adhd
13/10/2021, 20:27 - James: This is prime content, thank you for sharing. I also want all information delivered to my brain like this.
13/10/2021, 21:49 - Paul: Nathan is Flanders

13/10/2021, 22:02 - Paul: You're moe
13/10/2021, 22:04 - Dayle: yo i thought they deleted this of me.. WTF?
13/10/2021, 22:07 - Derren: There's actual Indians in this group bro how you gonna do me like that
13/10/2021, 22:18 - Qck: Now that's racist
13/10/2021, 22:31 - Wezz: Definitely not a shitpost

14/10/2021, 13:02 - James: Yeah, all the comments on that this morning were about how we're making the coolest things that will eventually subjugate and rule us
14/10/2021, 13:03 - Mike: The article is so hopeful, "useful in emergencies or for construction work"
14/10/2021, 13:05 - James: I've seen about 30 sci-fi films where these things zip through woodlands to machine gun down a group of plucky rebels
14/10/2021, 13:06 - Mike: Yeh it'll be chasing and bolt gunning to the brain escaped prisoners in no time
14/10/2021, 13:07 - Paul: Isn't it also usually the case that when the public finds out about this stuff it usually means the military has had it for like a decade already
14/10/2021, 13:10 - Nathan: I mean the military already use high speed high altitude aerial drones in overseas combat and intelligence scenarios so stands to reason that they would have smaller lighter and more manoeuvrable drones as well
14/10/2021, 13:11 - James: I think that used to be the case, but from the looks of this it's a research team project
14/10/2021, 13:12 - Paul: Yeah I guess private contractors pay way better than government these days
14/10/2021, 13:15 - James: It might not be scaleable either, these things are general much more achievable as a small scale/less considerations
14/10/2021, 15:37 - Dayle: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baY3SaIhfl0
14/10/2021, 16:00 - Mike: When someone reports finding a bug in a piece of work you're really proud of, oof the feels
14/10/2021, 16:01 - Mike: One by one the reporter informs the rest of the users, eventually all everyone is talking about is the whacky bug. Excuse my I need a whiskey to forget these feels.
14/10/2021, 16:06 - James: Hahaha, I've definitely found bugs like that where it's all you end up talking about
14/10/2021, 16:06 - James: I found one before where pressing space just typed the word SPACEBAR
14/10/2021, 16:06 - James: I have no idea how that happened, or who did it
14/10/2021, 16:43 - Wezz: Surely you throw in the odd SPACEBAR in emails to them every now and then
14/10/2021, 16:52 - James: I would, if I knew which dev actually put it in haha
14/10/2021, 16:56 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
14/10/2021, 16:57 - James: That's a no go Mr Frodo
14/10/2021, 16:58 - Qck: Rgds is definitely my new email sign-off
14/10/2021, 17:04 - James: I found the best sign off ever looking up a SQL server issue on a forum before
14/10/2021, 17:05 - James: <Media omitted>
14/10/2021, 17:06 - Mike: The British equivalent of dropping the N bomb
14/10/2021, 17:07 - James: Whenever I'm upset, I finish with "No regards, absolutely no regards at all" before gently closing the door
14/10/2021, 18:20 - Dayle: Hahaha
14/10/2021, 18:20 - Noone: Lee is sideshow Bob's smoking monkey

"A bakery in the United Kingdom says it will stop making its best-selling cookie after it was found to be using illegal sprinkles."
15/10/2021, 12:13 - Kirky: Yea so I heard üòÇ said he csnt afford to take his kids to Disney land cause "British sprinkles  are shit"
15/10/2021, 12:43 - Derren: Is it like looking in a mirror?
15/10/2021, 12:44 - Derren: Show Julia and say it's you leading a double life or say it's your long lost brother
15/10/2021, 12:47 - Paul: Ok mate it's not that similar
15/10/2021, 12:51 - Paul: I see that Chappelle pissed off the internet again lol
15/10/2021, 12:54 - Derren: He's your carbon copy
15/10/2021, 12:55 - Paul: Nope I've got a wider nose, smaller ears, different coloured hair and eyebrows and a better hairline (thanks wezz) but I definitely see the resemblance

15/10/2021, 13:50 - Qck: Imagine possibly losing 200 million dollars to play bouncy ball just because you're on the wrong side of covid vaccine mandates
15/10/2021, 13:51 - Qck: Dude should spend more time researching how to shoot ball in hoop instead of how the white man shoot autism into your balls

15/10/2021, 16:03 - Paul: Wezz can you make a Venn diagram on the Paul Jack Paul bubble image? Maybe that'll solve it.

15/10/2021, 16:08 - James: Is this some kind of demonic regex?
15/10/2021, 16:09 - Mike: nope, just adding empty arrays together which JS allows
15/10/2021, 16:10 - Paul: But why
15/10/2021, 16:10 - James: When you need to display you have a whole lot of nothing
15/10/2021, 16:11 - Paul: Mike's just merging black holes together

15/10/2021, 16:18 - Mike: Pop Quiz - Are you smarter than a compiler?
15/10/2021, 16:18 - Mike: const answer = [6, -2, 2, -7];
answer.sort();
console.log(answer);

what does this produce? No tricks, it will make an array of numbers
15/10/2021, 16:18 - Paul: He'd come bursting into my office like: "Paul I need these columns put next to each other stat!" And I'd be like, "ah man..."
15/10/2021, 16:19 - Paul: Doesn't it depend on the language?
15/10/2021, 16:19 - Mike: Go with javascript
15/10/2021, 16:19 - James: [-7, -2, 2,6]
15/10/2021, 16:20 - Paul: I would say the same
15/10/2021, 16:20 - Mike: <Media omitted>
15/10/2021, 16:20 - James: Though the way you phrased the question makes me believe compilers are stupid and would think 7
15/10/2021, 16:20 - James: oh
15/10/2021, 16:20 - James: Yeah
15/10/2021, 16:20 - James: Didn't even get to finish haha
15/10/2021, 16:20 - Paul: Can you flag it to be ascending
15/10/2021, 16:21 - Paul: Surely that's just a shitty sort function
15/10/2021, 16:21 - James: No Paul, 7 is bigger than 2
15/10/2021, 16:21 - James: All hail the robot overlords
15/10/2021, 16:21 - Mike: This guy has a degree in brain but doesn't know seven is bigger than 2
15/10/2021, 16:22 - James: Brains must work on golf rules, where 2 is bigger than 7
15/10/2021, 16:23 - Paul: I can't be wrong I've got a masters degree
15/10/2021, 16:29 - James: In what Paul? Other people's brains? Doesn't prove anything about your brain
15/10/2021, 16:32 - Wezz: 200mil I'd bounce on my boys dick
15/10/2021, 16:33 - Paul: I've literally got a scan of my brain on my pc
15/10/2021, 16:33 - Wezz: Thought about this for 30 seconds and my brain hurts
15/10/2021, 16:34 - Paul: How do you think I feel? I haven't slept since it was posted
15/10/2021, 16:35 - James: Oh, and we're supposed to believe your analysis of your own brain?
15/10/2021, 16:36 - Wezz: Paul's brain is sentient. Has a scan of itself
15/10/2021, 16:37 - Wezz: _Go on Paul, take another scan of me, I want to see myself_
15/10/2021, 16:37 - Paul: It scored 100% on the brain test

15/10/2021, 17:14 - Wezz: Just happened now lol, no taser though
15/10/2021, 17:15 - James: I thought it was pretty good journalism, you saw something, whipped out the phone and gave a good commentary. Felt like I was there and just missed it with you
15/10/2021, 17:18 - Piper: There was a lot of cars vans in the way
15/10/2021, 17:18 - Piper: Couldn't get a good shot
15/10/2021, 17:18 - James: Unlike the person with the TASER, amirite?

15/10/2021, 17:23 - Mike: Should have showed support and shouted Allahu Akbar
15/10/2021, 17:24 - Piper: Pretty racist
15/10/2021, 17:24 - Piper: Who said was muslim
15/10/2021, 17:26 - Mike: I think everyone of faith and creed likes to hear Allahu Akbar mate
15/10/2021, 18:16 - Paul: You'll never make it in this career
15/10/2021, 19:07 - Derren: Nice shit post

16/10/2021, 11:01 - Mike: Tell me James, do they still come trimmed with crumbs of bread?
16/10/2021, 11:02 - James: Indubitably sir
16/10/2021, 11:02 - Mike: Marvelous
16/10/2021, 13:32 - Paul: Same that was some quintessential british school food that pissed off Jamie Oliver
16/10/2021, 17:39 - Mike: Why are football referees always bald?
16/10/2021, 17:39 - Lockers: Because they like to be abused
16/10/2021, 17:39 - Lockers: Also they're not
16/10/2021, 17:39 - Lockers: Why are you watching Brentford Chelsea?

17/10/2021, 09:59 - James: His race of Aryan √úberhunds
17/10/2021, 10:07 - Noone: Too long have we been held down by the Pugish problem
17/10/2021, 10:52 - Wezz: YEAH AND WHAT BRUV

17/10/2021, 10:55 - Wezz: Golden Retriever is definitely the superior breed.
17/10/2021, 11:09 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
17/10/2021, 11:10 - Wezz: Start with the double bun part obviously, then use the burger as a bun for the second half
17/10/2021, 11:10 - Kirky: 2 burgers for the price of one !
17/10/2021, 11:10 - Paul: Are you psychotic
17/10/2021, 11:11 - Wezz: Obviously leave the gherkins in, no idea what this guy is doing. Chips in the tray is good McD etiquette though.
17/10/2021, 11:11 - Noone: Yes officer, it's him over there
17/10/2021, 11:12 - Dayle: League all day anyone
17/10/2021, 11:12 - Paul: That burger patty looks tragic
17/10/2021, 11:12 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
17/10/2021, 11:15 - Wezz: Tragically TASTY? Don't pretend you don't miss McDonalds Fillet boy
17/10/2021, 11:16 - Paul: Imaging living a shitty life as a cow then you become that awful excuse for a burger.
17/10/2021, 11:17 - Wezz: It's all about the sauce if I'm honest
17/10/2021, 11:17 - Paul: Like fine kill me if you must but at least put me in a beef Wellington or something
17/10/2021, 11:18 - Wezz: The patty is merely a vehicle for the sauce. The new double big mac is worse, more meat = less sauce ratio.
17/10/2021, 11:18 - Wezz: Also who wants a big bun, just put more sauce in it. Call it the double stuffed sauce. You're welcome
17/10/2021, 11:18 - Paul: Might as well get the veggie one with sauce then!
17/10/2021, 11:19 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
17/10/2021, 11:19 - Wezz: Mate, I'll take a veggie BigMac. There just isnt one
17/10/2021, 11:20 - Paul: You disassemble them anyway. Just buy 2 veggie burgers
17/10/2021, 11:20 - Paul: Checkmate
17/10/2021, 11:21 - Lockers: You need to be put in a straight jacket
17/10/2021, 11:21 - Lockers: This got me good üòÇ
17/10/2021, 11:23 - Dayle: For this enforcement of your veggie culture, I am eating twice as much meat today.. see what you did
17/10/2021, 11:24 - Wezz: You missed the part where there's no Big Mac sauce in a veggie burger, also veggie burgers are breaded and mostly weird beans. The new plant thing looks alright. Could slip a thin bit of leather in and call it meat and I'd be okay with it tbh
17/10/2021, 11:25 - Paul: You're stretching my McDonald's knowledge here bro can't you buy big Mac sauce?
17/10/2021, 11:25 - Paul: As long as it's beef wellington
17/10/2021, 11:26 - Paul: Also like you said, the patty is just a vehicle for the sauce. So beans/meat shouldn't matter
17/10/2021, 11:26 - Derren: Just ask for extra sauce
17/10/2021, 11:27 - Derren: You can do a lot of customising, you can ask for a veggie burger with big mac sauce
17/10/2021, 11:28 - Paul: Can I ask them to cook their beef pattys better?
17/10/2021, 11:29 - Derren: They put frozen discs on a grill then press a button to close the lid of the grill, it has a timer, after the timer the top half of the grill comes up, they put the patties in a plastic tray then into a heating cupboard
17/10/2021, 11:30 - Wezz: I'll just ask them to _do it better_.
17/10/2021, 11:30 - Paul: Yeah I'm just messing around I've eaten about 500 big macs
17/10/2021, 11:31 - Kirky: Is that 1000 split in half ?
17/10/2021, 11:31 - Kirky: I mean 250
17/10/2021, 11:32 - Kirky: Its early
17/10/2021, 11:44 - James: It's 1000 stacked into Mega Macs‚Ñ¢
17/10/2021, 11:45 - Wezz: What's the sauce ratio on a Mega Mac like?
17/10/2021, 11:46 - James: Abysmal, no-one with any sense makes them
17/10/2021, 11:46 - Wezz: SOLD

13/11/2021, 23:33 - Dayle: Donnay
14/11/2021, 09:24 - Paul: So Jack I was thinking about our self defense discussion yesterday: I just don't think that knowingly inserting yourself into a violent situation, or directly provoking a violent situation should be argued as self defense in all situations. I don't agree that it's the same as victim blaming. It opens a big can of worms where you can essentially instigate violence and then kill someone with impunity. It feels more nuanced to me than that.
14/11/2021, 09:44 - Noone: Since Kyle can't carry a gun because he's underage this argument gets confusing. But in the states, carrying a gun (in X states where open carry is legal) in the open is not provocation. He has the freedom of movement guaranteed by the constitution, but then of course there was a curfew in place after 8pm that night
14/11/2021, 09:46 - Paul: So I wanna clarify that I don't know the situation so correct me if I'm wrong. But he inserted himself into a dangerous situation (fight? Riot?) With an assault rifle. I feel like that can't be seen as anything other than provocative. Even in an open carry state it just seems batshit
14/11/2021, 09:47 - Noone: He went into a riot to put out fires and provide medical aid
14/11/2021, 09:47 - Paul: With an assault rifle
14/11/2021, 09:47 - Noone: with a rifle yes, he was not the only person there with a firearm however
14/11/2021, 09:48 - Paul: Hes a civilian right? He's not a marine or something?
14/11/2021, 09:48 - Noone: no evidence that he was using it to provoke violence however, he testified it was for his own protection
no he was 17 at the time
14/11/2021, 09:49 - Paul: Man I feel like it's it's own provocator
14/11/2021, 09:52 - Paul: I'd probably agree you can't charge him with premeditated murder but he deliberately inserted himself into a chaotic situation with a deadly weapon I just can't see how you can argue self defense after those actions. His motivations seem at a minimum, suspect.
14/11/2021, 09:52 - Noone: you could argue that brining a gun to a riot no matter the intention is by proxy provoking violence. In the states they have the right to carry a gun but there are clear laws in place in how you can use it, state by state. I dunno the laws of the state he was in- but the trial right now is not ofcussed on the fact he brought a gun into a riot, I don't think they can win on that argument
14/11/2021, 09:52 - Paul: But again I don't know the exact details I'm talking more hypothetically
14/11/2021, 09:53 - Noone: they're purely focucssed on his actions with the gun, the fact he has it won't impact whether it was self defence
14/11/2021, 09:53 - Paul: Does self defense change if you can prove they instigated the violence on themselves?
14/11/2021, 09:54 - Paul: Because if so then I think the gun is relevant
14/11/2021, 09:54 - Paul: Is self defense still valid if*
14/11/2021, 09:55 - Noone: prosection arguing he is the first aggressor, but they haven't made the argument that by having a gun he is the aggressor
14/11/2021, 09:55 - Paul: Extreme example: I bitchslap your mum in front of you and then kill you when you attack me
14/11/2021, 09:56 - Noone: the act of slapping me mum makes it clear you're the first aggressor
14/11/2021, 09:56 - Paul: But not on you
14/11/2021, 09:56 - Noone: he just had a gun on him- not the same as a clear provocation of violence
14/11/2021, 09:57 - Paul: Ok I bankrupt your mum in front of you no violence but you attack me.
14/11/2021, 09:57 - Paul: There's a weird grey area here is my point. Where's the line
14/11/2021, 09:58 - Paul: Probably because America love their guns so much without thinking. I feel like it's relevant more than anything else
14/11/2021, 09:58 - Noone: Physical violence I guess, verbal threats of violence maybe but that's where it gets tricky
14/11/2021, 09:59 - Noone: in the court of public opinion he's a loser. Unless he wants to work in right leaning businesses after he gets a not guilty then he'll have a hard time
14/11/2021, 10:00 - Paul: So imagine a guy walking around in the UK holding a knife but not threatening anyone directly. To me that's provocative
14/11/2021, 10:01 - Paul: If I came running into a riot to help people while carrying a bazooka I wonder how people would react
14/11/2021, 10:13 - Noone: you can't carry a knife here like you can carry a gun in the states
14/11/2021, 10:13 - Paul: That's not my point. It's about its influence on people not it's legality
14/11/2021, 10:16 - Noone: oh you can speculate on how people would react to anything, not much point though
14/11/2021, 10:16 - Noone: what matters is actions within and out of the law
14/11/2021, 10:16 - Paul: I think we're debating at cross purposes here
14/11/2021, 10:17 - Paul: My point is that it's reasonable to assume he incited violence regardless of the fact he was legally allowed to have his assault rifle
14/11/2021, 10:18 - Paul: Due to the connotations of carrying a deadly weapon into a chaotic and violent situation
14/11/2021, 10:20 - Noone: I don't agree
14/11/2021, 10:22 - Paul: And if it were a knife? Would you agree then?
14/11/2021, 10:23 - Noone: is there a precedant for carrying knives in America?
14/11/2021, 10:25 - Paul: Do you think people's entire psychology is dictated by the legality of things?
14/11/2021, 10:26 - Noone: you've lost me
14/11/2021, 10:26 - Paul: Man brings deadly weapon into chaotic situation could in some circumstances be considered a provocation or incitement of further violence yes or no
14/11/2021, 10:27 - Noone: I don't think he shot those people wanting to kill them, he's testified as such. They were the first aggressors physically and he saved his own life. Him being there in the first place was foolish but that isn't enough to condemn him to death and just let people smash his brains in and shoot him.
14/11/2021, 10:28 - Noone: in the states? no it's not
14/11/2021, 10:28 - Paul: No Jack in life. In reality. Think as a human not a robot
14/11/2021, 10:29 - Paul: I'm not talking about the law
14/11/2021, 10:29 - Paul: I'm talking about what actually happened
14/11/2021, 10:30 - Paul: I feel like you know exactly what I'm saying
14/11/2021, 10:30 - Paul: I completely agree
14/11/2021, 10:31 - Noone: I know what you're saying, I just don't agree with you that's all
14/11/2021, 10:32 - Paul: Which is fine but then when I give you another example you respond with something irrelevant
14/11/2021, 10:32 - Noone: you asked me if carrying a gun to a riot is provoking violence, In the context of the states I don't think it is
14/11/2021, 10:33 - Noone: in the UK sure, nobody carries shooters other than Misto's friends and farmers
14/11/2021, 10:33 - Derren: Is Paul saying this guy only went into the riot to help because he felt confident because of having a gun
14/11/2021, 10:34 - Paul: No
14/11/2021, 10:35 - Paul: I'm saying there's an argument that entering into a riot with a deadly weapon (legal or not) can incite further violent reactions and thus self defense against him could be argued to be not valid.

Because otherwise self defense laws can easily be abused
14/11/2021, 10:37 - Noone: you're making a legal argument (incite) but ignoring other aspects of the law
14/11/2021, 10:37 - Noone: you can pick and choose whatever parts of the law you want and get to the answer you're looking for
14/11/2021, 10:38 - Paul: Pick any other word you prefer to make the context clear that I'm talking about the behaviours of the people and not the law
14/11/2021, 10:39 - Paul: Maybe incite has a specific definition I'm not aware of in a legal context. But the concept of inciting violence should be obvious practically
14/11/2021, 10:41 - Noone: to incite makes you the baddie
14/11/2021, 10:42 - Paul: Doesn't need to be intentional though
14/11/2021, 10:43 - Derren: Would being a professional mma fighter for example be considered as a deadly weapon
14/11/2021, 10:43 - Paul: I think the whole "register you fists as deadly weapons" thing was just PR
14/11/2021, 10:45 - Derren: Yeah but knowing you could win a fight with 99.99% of the human population would give you confidence to just involved in more situations that could lead to violence
14/11/2021, 10:45 - Paul: But it's an interesting question. Can at a certain threshold, a person being intimidating be considered provocative
14/11/2021, 10:46 - Paul: Impossible to control for but in reality yeah I think so
14/11/2021, 10:46 - Derren: Which by the logic you're using you could argue that they got into that situation knowing that so they could also be inciting violence or provoking
14/11/2021, 10:46 - Paul: E.g. biker gangs
14/11/2021, 10:47 - Derren: Because a non fighting person would not be in that situation or would have left earlier and not allowed it to escalate
14/11/2021, 10:48 - Paul: I'm assuming most people in a riot are also inciting violence. That's also kinda why self defense becomes tricky. It's almost like a gentlemen's agreement that we all take on the risks associated with being here
14/11/2021, 10:48 - James: Would having scimitars for arms be considered a deadly weapon?
14/11/2021, 10:48 - Derren: Then as you said too being in a group also has an influence on these things
14/11/2021, 10:49 - Paul: Nah that's fine
14/11/2021, 10:49 - Derren: Anyway real question is, if you take nude pics of yourself at 14 are you creating child porn and can you be arrested for it
14/11/2021, 10:49 - Paul: Yes you paedo
14/11/2021, 10:50 - Derren: What if you and your partner make a fuck tape at 15, is that child porn, who gets in trouble
14/11/2021, 10:50 - Paul: Specifically you even if you aren't involved
14/11/2021, 10:50 - Derren: Even if it is only for you?
14/11/2021, 10:50 - Lockers: No the question is why is this on your mind you creep?
14/11/2021, 10:50 - Paul: Someone arrest this man
14/11/2021, 10:50 - Derren: I have nudes of myself at 14 init
14/11/2021, 10:51 - Paul: We got 'em boys
14/11/2021, 10:51 - Lockers: Ok and why haven't they been deleted?
14/11/2021, 10:51 - Derren: Cos it's of myself
14/11/2021, 10:52 - Paul: Did you get them off lockers harddrive?
14/11/2021, 10:52 - Derren: üëÄ
14/11/2021, 10:52 - Lockers: Still the fucking creepiest thing to happen and try and play off that it's OK
14/11/2021, 10:54 - Paul: Definite psychopath vibes
14/11/2021, 10:56 - Derren: Waiting for the next meet up to kill you all
14/11/2021, 11:04 - Paul: <Media omitted>
14/11/2021, 11:06 - Derren: @447428100241 @447758520258 think this is for you guys
14/11/2021, 11:12 - Wezz: Law dictates a large part of what is deemed acceptable and 'normal'. Sounds like open carrying is pretty normal in this state. Seems obviously inciting to us, but may not be the case locally.
14/11/2021, 11:17 - Paul: I could *maybe* buy that for hand guns but assault rifles?
14/11/2021, 11:18 - Paul: That can't be that ubiquitous
14/11/2021, 11:18 - Wezz: Just to clarify, if I see any kinda gun in a stressful situation I'm screaming and pissing myself.
14/11/2021, 11:18 - Paul: But that's your reaction to everything üôÑ
14/11/2021, 11:20 - Wezz: üòÇ if people start open carrying in my local Sainsbury's I'd get used to it after a few months. "Excuse me sir, just need to get the hummus from behind your M16"
14/11/2021, 11:20 - Derren: His reaction is to sweat profusely
14/11/2021, 11:20 - Derren: ‚ù§Ô∏è
14/11/2021, 11:20 - Wezz: I'm not the one with child porn on my HDDs üßê
14/11/2021, 11:21 - Derren: Smart phones didn't exist when I was under age and I was too poor to own a camera
14/11/2021, 11:22 - Wezz: IANAL, but this ain't holding up in court Derek.
14/11/2021, 11:22 - Wezz: You've had 10+ years to think up a defence
14/11/2021, 11:23 - Wezz: Links to anal:
OnlyFans.com/sweatywezz
14/11/2021, 11:24 - Derren: Seriously though
14/11/2021, 11:24 - Derren: How can you get in trouble for having those pics of yourself
14/11/2021, 11:25 - Derren: Like can you get arrested for attempted murder if you stab yourself
14/11/2021, 11:25 - Derren: Would you have 2 sets of lawyers for yourself
14/11/2021, 11:28 - Wezz: I don't know what the precedent is with sex tapes. Surely solo stuff is 100% fine.
14/11/2021, 11:28 - Paul: The context matters. Carrying a hockey stick or a baseball bat is also acceptable and normal. A teacher carrying stationary is legal and fine. But show up to a riot with a pair of scissors or a cricket bat and you're inciting violence imo
14/11/2021, 11:41 - Wezz: For sure. I think some of the gunheads open carry 24/7, 'I need it to feel safe' 'under the pillow' types.

The sheer volatility of guns make for loads of _arguably_ preventable situations like this, but hard to interpret them outside of the local culture surrounding gun ownership and acceptance. And it's so bloody difficult to revoke gun laws when they're in place (for a bazillion reasons).
14/11/2021, 11:42 - Wezz: E.g. the gun is an extension of themself, not a tool used to perform a certain task as the ones you listed.
14/11/2021, 11:43 - Dayle: not unless your NZ
14/11/2021, 11:47 - Dayle: He is just a silly little boy with delusions of grandeur, thinking he is important enough to so solo and do what professionals should be doing, Police & Ambalam Services, It should be used to set an example of this willy nilly free willy actions of doing what he did, with the consequences of killing someone, as that is the only result of his logic with the gun in a heated crowd
14/11/2021, 11:50 - Wezz: Also, guns represent more than self defence to a lot of them, weird cultish vibes. Akin to how we _let_ the Middle East grossly mistreat women, we _let_ gun owners occasionally shoot people üéÖ
14/11/2021, 11:56 - Dayle: just get a gun and shoot first 4Head
14/11/2021, 11:56 - Wezz: Paul's never been an entry fragger
14/11/2021, 11:57 - Wezz: Has been an entry fagger though LOL
14/11/2021, 11:58 - Dayle: is that someone who has just come out?
14/11/2021, 11:59 - Wezz: Congrats Paul, we're all very proud, I know it was tough on Julia but you did what was right and you'll always have our love and support x
14/11/2021, 12:00 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
14/11/2021, 12:07 - Mike: It's called attempted suicide and is illegal lol
14/11/2021, 12:13 - Mike: Only in America could bringing a deadly weapon into an extreme situation be an excusable act of self defence
14/11/2021, 12:15 - Kirky: <Media omitted>
14/11/2021, 12:17 - Mike: For the crime of wanting to die I sentence you to life.
14/11/2021, 12:20 - Wezz: We recently had to remove all the metal coat hooks from walls at work, because someone (at a random hospital) attempted to strangle themselves using one. So now we have these rubber hooks that are somewhat reminiscent of paper straws.

Do they do that in prison? Remove risks of suicide?
14/11/2021, 12:23 - Mike: Ask Epstein
14/11/2021, 12:24 - Dayle: That was murder mike
14/11/2021, 12:26 - Wezz: If I wanted to ask a kiddie fiddler I'd ask Misto.
14/11/2021, 12:27 - Wezz: But should we even care if prisoners commit suicide? I mean, I know it's supposed to be a rehabilitation centre. We could just say fuck it and turn 'em all into Squid Games.

14/11/2021, 13:44 - Dayle: Also people who baked bread then baked the bread to make toast
14/11/2021, 13:45 - Mike: Or they just left it in the oven
14/11/2021, 13:45 - Dayle: ITS JUST BURNT BREAD THEN?
14/11/2021, 13:46 - Mike: üçû
14/11/2021, 13:46 - Mike: üî•
14/11/2021, 15:15 - Paul: Time for DnD?

14/11/2021, 15:39 - Paul: Help
14/11/2021, 16:23 - Kirky: rip paul
14/11/2021, 17:15 - Qck: Glad someone's asking the big questions
14/11/2021, 17:16 - Qck: I think that's called attempted suicide
14/11/2021, 17:17 - Qck: Oh Mike already had a pop at you for that
14/11/2021, 17:22 - Dayle: <Media omitted>
14/11/2021, 17:28 - Kirky: Do you wake up and read everything you missed ?
14/11/2021, 17:29 - Wezz: QCK's alarm goes off at 5pm
14/11/2021, 17:29 - Wezz: ...he usually snoozes a few times
14/11/2021, 17:29 - Qck: Skim as fast as possible, saw 140 missed messages and thought to myself fuck me isn't that an average of 10 messages per person
14/11/2021, 17:29 - Qck: Then realised it was 90% Paul pretending he doesn't understand how the world works
14/11/2021, 17:29 - Kirky: Usually Paul and wezz pretending to be smart
14/11/2021, 17:29 - Qck: Speaking of snoozers

14/11/2021, 19:46 - Paul: Yes I saw it on reddit fucking sue me
14/11/2021, 19:48 - Qck: Like Elon I know you have no liquid assets so why bother
14/11/2021, 19:49 - Paul: I took a shit on your computer
14/11/2021, 19:51 - Qck: I don't remember you being at LAN when we all did that
14/11/2021, 19:52 - Paul: You were too high
14/11/2021, 19:52 - Qck: Makes sense
14/11/2021, 19:52 - Kirky: He was there behind the desk remember?
14/11/2021, 19:53 - Qck: Oooooh yeah God damn, he was in shitting distance as well
14/11/2021, 19:53 - Paul: It was basically the whole point of the LAN
14/11/2021, 20:09 - Wezz: I was planning to take that secret to the grave
14/11/2021, 20:10 - Wezz: He's a bond villain. But also a massive dweeb who would lose go Dayle in a body shots only boxing fight on Ramsgate seafront üíØ
14/11/2021, 20:23 - Kirky: Most bond villains would though
14/11/2021, 20:23 - Paul: True true
14/11/2021, 20:24 - Paul: Jaws would fuck Dayle up
14/11/2021, 20:24 - Kirky: Nah dayle wins 99/100
14/11/2021, 20:25 - Paul: Dude he's got metal teeth

15/11/2021, 09:16 - Kirky: Agreeed
15/11/2021, 09:16 - Kirky: IM FUCKING ED SHEERAN
15/11/2021, 10:24 - Dayle: Bitch hahaha
15/11/2021, 11:14 - Paul: same
15/11/2021, 11:23 - Wezz: Venomous/Toxic and dying. Same difference
15/11/2021, 11:24 - Paul: Do you guys give money to homeless people? Yes/No and why?
15/11/2021, 11:33 - James: Yes, because making them fight without paying them would be immoral
15/11/2021, 11:35 - Wezz: Ah, the ole *homeless manoeuvre*.
I usually take my dick out and start furiously masturbating; that's when the race truly begins. The upset of his circumstances keeps me flaccid while my sudden sense of superiority makes me want to come. I pound my limp noodle with such vigor I endure equal parts rope burn, redemption and regret. As the purgatory ejaculate slinkies out of my flaccid gentry wiener.
15/11/2021, 11:35 - Paul: Be honest you googled how to spell manoeuvre
15/11/2021, 11:36 - Paul: that word is absolute nonsense
15/11/2021, 11:36 - Wezz: I googled it, and I still don't believe it's correct.
15/11/2021, 11:36 - Wezz: ...it's got me doubting Google.
15/11/2021, 11:37 - Paul: I've never seen "cum" spelt "come"
15/11/2021, 11:40 - Wezz: Writing "cum" weirds me out. I've somehow associated it with being a teenager.
15/11/2021, 11:41 - Paul: how about the noun
15/11/2021, 11:42 - James: Yeah, I feel like if you don't like spelling it cum, you need to move on to ejaculate or expel, or even just finish. CUM IS CUM.
15/11/2021, 11:42 - Paul: Cum means cum and brexit means brexit - Theresa May
15/11/2021, 11:43 - James: Brexit means cum, and cum means breakfast - Trees are gay
15/11/2021, 11:43 - Wezz: Do you have a problem with gay trees?
15/11/2021, 11:44 - Wezz: Cause I heard you have a gay tree problem
15/11/2021, 11:46 - Paul: Did you know we send ¬£250,000,000 each week to the Gay Tree's? We're gonna stop that and save the money
15/11/2021, 11:46 - James: We want Treebeard, not Treequeer'd
15/11/2021, 11:47 - Wezz: Unless you write it on a big coach I'll never believe it. It's the only way I trust things nowadays
15/11/2021, 11:48 - Wezz: It's a nightmare as I'm rather insecure, my wife tries her best.
15/11/2021, 11:49 - Wezz: LOTR reference but I wouldn't know ü•≤
15/11/2021, 11:52 - James: The woke media tried to force the ents gay by removing all the entwives
15/11/2021, 11:58 - Wezz: You act like if all women disappeared (see: Children of Men) we'd not all be jerking each other off after a few years.
15/11/2021, 11:58 - Wezz: *days.

15/11/2021, 12:04 - Paul: <Media omitted>
15/11/2021, 12:08 - Derren: I'm paying taxes and shit for a reason, it's up to the local council / gov to sort that shit out, me giving a fiver is making no difference as I have no idea what it's going to, better off donating to a charity
15/11/2021, 12:12 - Wezz: Are places accepting shit as payment now?
15/11/2021, 12:13 - Wezz: Or are you buying shit?
15/11/2021, 12:13 - Wezz: I'm confused
15/11/2021, 12:29 - Qck: Imagine being this off base
15/11/2021, 12:30 - Qck: I give money to the homeless but I make them promise me first that they'll only be buying drugs with it
15/11/2021, 12:35 - Lee: Yeah, I give money to homeless people. Although I really don't carry cash anymore, so it's few and far between these days.
15/11/2021, 12:48 - Wezz: The 'why' is interesting. It's some kinda innate desire to help others. You definitely feel good afterwards too, it could be seen as a pretty cheap way to buy the "I'm making a tangible difference" feeling. It feel it starts from a kind place - and is often impulsive.
15/11/2021, 12:49 - Wezz: You sell them the drugs after though, yin-yang Sam
15/11/2021, 13:10 - Paul: James and I were discussing how, if you ignore the empathy, it's essentially the same idea as recycling. It's an issue that's forced onto us workers that really we have no way to solve ourselves
15/11/2021, 13:25 - Dayle: https://www.spin.com/2021/11/brass-against-sophia-urista-pee-fan-face-welcome-to-rockville/

15/11/2021, 13:26 - Qck: If this is the full video of Sophia Urista doing a pee on a middle aged metalhead's face I implore you all to watch it
15/11/2021, 13:26 - Paul: I was gonna type proletariat but didn't wanna upset people
15/11/2021, 13:26 - Qck: She is fucking desperate for a slash
15/11/2021, 13:26 - Qck: Lmao so was I for my joke
15/11/2021, 13:27 - Qck: But couldn't think of a third commie word for the golden rule of comedy, due to not being a commie
15/11/2021, 14:27 - Kirky: CLASH SATURDAY
15/11/2021, 14:27 - Kirky: if people are around
15/11/2021, 14:28 - Kirky: saying that i might not be lol
15/11/2021, 16:05 - Wezz: Yet to see the video. She looks pretty hot in that still. _No idea who she was until she peed on a fan_ (said with Bane voice)

15/11/2021, 22:56 - Noone: Leave Misto alone, poor little guy
15/11/2021, 22:57 - Lockers: Stupid cunt

15/11/2021, 22:58 - Noone: my assessment is you need to have 50cc's of wank, a night on the town and a good long shit
15/11/2021, 22:59 - Noone: thank you, that'll be all. Nurse Phillips will see you out
15/11/2021, 22:59 - Noone: *nurse?*
15/11/2021, 22:59 - Noone: *NURSE?*
15/11/2021, 22:59 - Lockers: I'm not fucking leaving til I get this nurse you cunt
15/11/2021, 23:00 - Noone: one moment please Mr.Lockers, our nurse should be here to show you out.
15/11/2021, 23:00 - Noone: feel free to play with the childrens toys in the waiting room. While you're at it, could you pass me the duplo's please, my lunch break starts in 5 minutes
15/11/2021, 23:00 - Lockers: No fuck off
15/11/2021, 23:02 - Noone: you can start your treatment immediately if you wish, a good wank should start you off nicely. You can do it in the same place you would find those Duplos, and please try to aim away from them- thank you
15/11/2021, 23:02 - Paul: Said Jack to the mirror
15/11/2021, 23:03 - Noone: who let you in here- *NUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRSSSSSSEEEEEEEEE*
15/11/2021, 23:03 - Lockers: Hahahahaha GOT HIM
15/11/2021, 23:06 - Noone: They never told me being a football coach would be this difficult

16/11/2021, 12:20 - James: My email wasn't working this morning, so I asked my magic 8 ball why. It replied Outlook not so good.
16/11/2021, 12:23 - Paul: boo
16/11/2021, 12:40 - Mike: Over the last 14 years, my dad has spent 3 years logged into wow. As in actual time played 3 years.
16/11/2021, 12:43 - Mike: And the worst part is he keyboard turns still to this day
16/11/2021, 12:47 - Paul: 26298 hours, damn
16/11/2021, 13:22 - Wezz: Thought this was a follow up to James' joke, then I just felt sad. Does he still play now?
16/11/2021, 13:23 - Nathan: 1 character? Now that's impressive!
16/11/2021, 13:24 - Wezz: This is depressing. Also, the signs/symptoms are bloody right on the nose. Have seen worker uprisings before and they all start with these little shared resentment. And they know nipping it in the bud early is the best way. Makes me feel a bit sick tbh
16/11/2021, 13:26 - Derren: Doesn't he just leave the game open even tho he's not playing lol

17/11/2021, 12:57 - Dayle: Near the launch of SLOBS, @streamlabs reached out to us about using the OBS name. We kindly asked them not to. They did so anyway and followed up by filing a trademark

We‚Äôve tried to sort this out in private and they have been uncooperative at every turn

17/11/2021, 14:12 - Wezz: I do this often, also reenable IPV6 when things aren't working. Swear it fixes 99% of problems.
17/11/2021, 14:23 - James: My go to was always IPConfig /release and /renew
17/11/2021, 14:26 - Paul: I just threaten to upgrade it and it gets scared and works
17/11/2021, 14:28 - Wezz: Yeah, used to do the same in cmd. Pretty sure it's forces renew/flush when you disable/enable.
17/11/2021, 14:29 - Wezz: Chemtech gonna be interesting - so strong in low ELO. Hextech gates super cool. And comeback mechanics with the objective bounties, finally nubs gonna focus objectives.
17/11/2021, 14:52 - Paul: fun fact, it's Elo, not ELO, it's named after a person
17/11/2021, 14:52 - Wezz: <Media omitted>
17/11/2021, 14:54 - James: fun fact, it's Elmo, not Elo, it's named after a puppet

What kind of eating disorder can a 5 year old posses to justify a diet of a four year old being mostly comprised of crisps
18/11/2021, 09:58 - Noone: aren't eating disorders learned? surely this child hasn't had the exposure to any societal pressures regarding body shape? This must be the parents being grade A retards surely
18/11/2021, 10:03 - Kirky: Surely just the kid screaming I WANT CRISPS and the parents giving in
18/11/2021, 10:06 - Paul: Depends what you mean by learned
18/11/2021, 10:06 - Mike: They call it Jack Noone syndrome
18/11/2021, 10:09 - Paul: Some kids can go through really avoidant eating behaviours which is to be expected. When your kid won't eat and you've tried everything I can see why they might have tried crisps. Seems very extreme though

18/11/2021, 11:37 - Wezz: But as long as the 5 year old is the one recording it, it's fine right? Asking for a friend @447588936693

19/11/2021, 10:32 - Wezz: *Friday question time.*

What's the saddest TV/movie scene you've ever watched?
19/11/2021, 10:42 - Noone: Spoilers for Arrival:

The ending scene where the main character realises the visions she's been having were of her future child she knows will die tragically, but decides to have her anyway. The reveal for me was even more powerful because a scene where she's basically told she will see the future by an Alien was bugged in the subtitles, so i was just shown the Alien language and her reaction. So all the pieces fell together for me in that closing section and it was like a mixture of sudden realisation and overwhelming sadness
19/11/2021, 10:43 - Noone: Jumping onto *Friday question time.* where is a good place to go for a work social that isn't just the pub? We've been suggested bowling which tbh sounds bretty good
19/11/2021, 10:49 - Mike: Futurama, I Will Wait For You gotta be in there
19/11/2021, 10:50 - Wezz: Didn't really clarify, but doesn't have to be super renowned or anything. Just a scene that stuck with you and hit weird.
19/11/2021, 10:51 - Paul: The only movie I ever turned off because I couldn't actually handle watching it was Hard Candy
19/11/2021, 10:51 - Wezz: This movie was sick btw.
19/11/2021, 10:51 - Paul: But I was like 16, so dunno if that's still true
19/11/2021, 10:52 - Paul: Basically anything involving anything negative towards dogs absolutely destroys me. Dog got put down on Grey's Anatomy the other day and I nearly cried
19/11/2021, 10:52 - Mike: Was that a bug? I thought it was intended
19/11/2021, 10:54 - Wezz: Marley and Me
19/11/2021, 10:54 - Kirky: Mini golf
19/11/2021, 10:55 - Mike: Does animated count? The Plague Dogs will fuck you up bloody
19/11/2021, 10:55 - Paul: Watched that before we got Fred, I don't think I could watch it now lol
19/11/2021, 10:56 - Mike: Escape rooms, Batting Cage, Arcades
19/11/2021, 10:56 - Paul: Just pile them all into Piper's room
19/11/2021, 11:14 - Derren: Strip club
19/11/2021, 11:15 - Kirky: Thought that said battle cage
19/11/2021, 11:15 - Derren: When ironside3 lost to carbide
19/11/2021, 11:34 - Noone: Nope I watched it recently and there are in film subtitles, for the scene where she's within the alien area (behind the glass). There may be different versions
19/11/2021, 11:34 - Noone: Dude true
19/11/2021, 11:50 - Lockers: 100%
19/11/2021, 11:54 - Wezz: Normie office shit like Ping Pong (Bounce), Mini Golf (Swingers), Arcades (Four Quarters, Pimpshuei).
19/11/2021, 11:55 - Wezz: Some mega arcade complex opened called *Gravity* near Battersea. Wanna go. Has multifloor go karts, loads of cool new interactive takes on bowling, darts, pool, etc.
19/11/2021, 11:56 - Mike: Board game cafes are pretty cool too
19/11/2021, 11:59 - Wezz: Yeah this is a nice happy medium, if the company is good. And means you don't have to spend a tonne of money.

19/11/2021, 15:16 - Qck: Weird as this is the only movie I ever felt turned on over
19/11/2021, 15:17 - Qck: Picked up weed from a weedy last week and I asked dude what he was doing with his evening "going gravity with my neice" oh no shit I replied as gravity is a 5 min walk from me so why the FUCK am I in Croydon
19/11/2021, 15:22 - Qck: The saddest scene from TV?

Probably when they put all of that food in the tube in supersize vs superskinny.

Or when the supersize follows the superskinny's diet and you see them spreading low fat marg on a cornflake.

19/11/2021, 16:48 - Noone: Nigga don't @ me
19/11/2021, 16:55 - Wezz: Did the @ sign have a meaning before email?
19/11/2021, 17:15 - James: Historically had a few different meanings, but the most common is to mean 'at the rate of' in accounting and finance ledgers
19/11/2021, 17:17 - Dayle: yeah, but you dont know how to dodge a Q, so yeah
19/11/2021, 17:17 - James: Are you @ing me?

19/11/2021, 21:21 - Dayle: So I agree
19/11/2021, 21:21 - Qck: Only thing that's getting shot by you is the shots in that photo
19/11/2021, 21:21 - Qck: Do your shots and stop thinking about guns
19/11/2021, 21:22 - Noone: *YES LETS GO*
19/11/2021, 21:22 - Noone: Been following this trial for what feels like weeks at this point what a result
19/11/2021, 21:23 - Dayle: <Media omitted>
19/11/2021, 21:23 - Qck: You booed the Nuremberg trials though
19/11/2021, 21:25 - Noone: Because you can't account for the wooden doors
19/11/2021, 21:26 - Noone: What a LAD can't wait to see the threads about this
19/11/2021, 21:28 - Noone: <Media omitted>
19/11/2021, 21:28 - Noone: <Media omitted>
19/11/2021, 21:29 - Dayle: Did he kill white donnoes?
19/11/2021, 21:29 - Noone: <Media omitted>
19/11/2021, 21:29 - Noone: Yeah he killed two white guys lol
19/11/2021, 21:30 - Dayle: National dcum
19/11/2021, 21:30 - Kirky: And shot a 3rd
19/11/2021, 21:31 - Dayle: Killed his hopes and dreams of being a marytr
19/11/2021, 21:31 - Kirky: Invite him in chat Jack, biggest gamer here
19/11/2021, 21:31 - Noone: What a LAD, took out a pedo and a commie all in one night and gets away with it
19/11/2021, 21:34 - Dayle: Don't let Paul hear you say that
19/11/2021, 21:34 - Dayle: Paul's a commie, not a pedo clearing it up
19/11/2021, 21:34 - Noone: Thanks for clearing that up

19/11/2021, 21:47 - Paul: Hey guys let's keep it civil and respect the process
19/11/2021, 21:47 - Paul: Lol fuck off
19/11/2021, 21:49 - Paul: Before even researching the trial I know which was the correct side to be on just by hearing Jack's opinion on it and that he was so vitriolic in following it and telling us how much he followed it. Red flags everywhere amirite
19/11/2021, 22:00 - Kirky: Have you watched the video of him shooting?
19/11/2021, 23:05 - Derren: @447835575116 https://www.dumpert.nl/?selectedId=100015316_dda5cc24
19/11/2021, 23:05 - Derren: üòÇ
20/11/2021, 06:32 - Paul: Nope
20/11/2021, 06:55 - Paul: But to be clear I don't think there's anything in a video that would change my mind about his decisions. I don't think you can consider them ethically without the wider context
20/11/2021, 07:20 - Qck: To be clear I think every child should receive an AR-15 after their first Fortnite win
20/11/2021, 07:22 - Qck: I also think every dog should be equipped with metal teeth and every tree on this pale blue dot be uprooted, pulped and turned into yu-gi-oh cards
20/11/2021, 07:24 - Paul: Sam for president
20/11/2021, 07:24 - Qck: I would chemically and physically castrate Derren
20/11/2021, 07:27 - Qck: I'd cook everybody a fish supper
20/11/2021, 07:28 - Qck: Lightbulbs would be made from magic
20/11/2021, 07:29 - Qck: These are just some of my policies, a vote for Sam is a vote for ham
20/11/2021, 07:29 - Qck: One of the policies involves ham
20/11/2021, 07:42 - Paul: What is your policy on the conflict in the middle east?
20/11/2021, 07:43 - Qck: Resurrect Saddam via witchcraft
20/11/2021, 07:49 - Qck: Sorry no I wouldn't
20/11/2021, 07:50 - Qck: I'd let Dayle drop a beatbox

20/11/2021, 08:57 - Paul: <Media omitted>
20/11/2021, 09:04 - Paul: The Ghislaine Maxwell trial starts today right? Now that'll be far more interesting than this retard shit
20/11/2021, 10:27 - Kirky: If she makes it to the courtroom
20/11/2021, 10:30 - Paul: I feel like they must have some reassurances that she isn't gonna talk considering she's still alive
20/11/2021, 10:40 - Kirky: Maybe theyve designated a couple low ranking people she can throw under the bus so it looks like they got em to the public
20/11/2021, 11:14 - Noone: watching Netflix's Cowboy Bebop, wish me luck
20/11/2021, 11:16 - Kirky: Let me know
